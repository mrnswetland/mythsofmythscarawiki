The tales about [[./Karametra|Karametra]] don’t specify what ignited the god’s rage in ancient times, but they do record that for a year, she tore down her own temples and refused to let any plants grow. The mortals of the world, threatened with starvation, beseeched her to curb her wrath. In an effort led by [[./Karametra|Karametra]]’s priests, nearly all of humanity prayed for a week, neither eating nor sleeping, praising [[./Karametra|Karametra]] for her serenity and generosity. After that time, she relented and produced a miraculous crop of grapes that cured illness and fed the people. Ever since then, her statues have been adorned with twining grape vines around their left wrists in commemoration of that event.
