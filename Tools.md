## Tools

A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your [proficiency bonus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#ProficiencyBonus) to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your [woodcarver’s tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/118-woodcarvers-tools), or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
