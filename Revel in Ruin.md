The summer festival of the [[./Megasphagion|Megasphagion]] is a domesticated version of [[./Mogis|Mogis]]’s typical rites. It involves the sacrifice of many cattle to avert [[./Mogis|Mogis]]’s wrath. The meat is then cooked and distributed among all who attend the festival. The grand feast that follows tends to devolve into a drunken revel. In some tales, individuals or communities with long-held grudges find themselves incensed during the festival, leading them to seek violent ends to their rivalries.
