If you have an Inspiration Point, you can take an Action or Bonus Action outside your turn. This can only be used at the end of another creature’s turn.
	• Only one Inspiration Action or Legendary Action can be taken at the end of another creature’s turn from everyone on the battlefield. Meaning you cannot have multiple creatures take Inspiration Actions or Legendary Actions at the end of the same creature’s turn. 
	• If a creature is about to take a Legendary Action, this can be overridden with an Inspiration Action. The Legendary Action is not spent. 
	• This must be determined before the Legendary Action’s result. Otherwise, the Inspiration Action cannot be taken. 
	• You can only take one Inspiration Action per round.
