A kraken that escaped its sea lock once threatened the small seaside city of [[./St. Harbor|St. Harbor]]. Recently weakened by a triton raid, the city had no defenses left and would be destroyed by an attack. The people prayed to [[./Ephara|Ephara]], and the large image of her face on the cityâ€™s wall came to life. The walls of the city grew impossibly high and strong, and the kraken could do no more than dash its head against the impassable barrier. The monster soon returned to the ocean to find an easier meal.
