When [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]] attacked [[./Heliod|Heliod]] in a destructive rage, [[./Heliod|Heliod]] demanded that [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] intervene. [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] constrained the forge-god’s mind and memory in punishment for his attack. He warned all the gods that if they threatened the mortal realm with their disruptive quarrels, he would bind them to [[./Nyx|Nyx]] for as long as he saw fit. As of yet, no god has dared to test [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]’s threat, but there are certainly those among them who might try if they could see a way to retain their own powers.
