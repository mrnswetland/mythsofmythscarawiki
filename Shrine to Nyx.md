According to one tale, it was [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]], not [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]], who was the first to fashion living [[./Nyxborn|Nyxborn]] creatures from the fabric of [[./Nyx|Nyx]]. [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] created the divine artisan [[./Nykthos|Nykthos]] and ordered him to build altars to the gods. [[./Nykthos|Nykthos]]’s story isn’t widely known among mortals, but the [[Shrine to Nyx|Shrine to Nyx]] is still called [[./Nykthos|Nykthos]] in his honor.
