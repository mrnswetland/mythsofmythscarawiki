**So, during a long rest, a player can make a check using smithing tools to modify a weapon, or if they are at a forge/workshop, they can attempt to forge a new weapon. You can make or modify weapons using monster materials you have harvested, or using other ores or other rare materials you’ve mined or gathered in the wild.

  

## Materials

All materials listed below hold the potential to give a wide range of beneficial properties to any weapons you craft (See Monster Material Blueprints). Different materials may be more difficult to work with than others, and so might require better work environments to refine the material. Not just any old forge will do for some of these materials, and working with them in the wrong environments will lower their quality. In the tables provided for each monster material blueprint, you will see that they are categorized by CR level. The CR level of a material is usually equal to that of the monster it was harvested from. However, as mentioned in “Harvesting Materials”, below, this CR level may be lowered or raised depending on how well it was salvaged. Other factors that might affect a material’s CR level, is refining it at an inappropriate workshop (see Refining Materials below). Materials of a certain CR will require a specific tier of workshop to refine it correctly, and some may be impossible to refine if the workshop is too low a tier. For example, one would assume the bones of a demon, that naturally resist heat, would be near impossible to smelt down in a regular furnace.

  

## Harvesting Materials

At the end of an encounter, each party member can salvage 1 monster material each. These monster materials can either be ingredients for cooking or Alchemy, or material for smithing or runecraft. Make sure your players specify which they are harvesting at this time, as ingredients can expire, while materials will not, but require a different skill check.

When salvaging materials from a creature you must make a survival check (DC 5 + the monster’s CR level). If you fail this check, you still harvest the material but it is considered “Flawed”, and its CR level is reduced by 2. If you succeed, however, the material is unaffected. Succeeding the check by 5 or more will ensure that the material is of “Flawless” quality, increasing its CR level by 1.

  

## Material CR Level & Item Quality 

When a weapon or armor is created, it will have an item quality, based on the original creature it was taken from, the quality of the material when harvested, and finally how well the material was refined, as well as how many other refined materials were added to the item itself. And so when you craft a weapon or piece of armor, the end result of its item quality will typically be equal to the CR level of the material used. However, as mentioned in “Harvesting Materials”, the CR level of the material may not equal that of the creature it was harvested from, depending on how well the harvesting process went.

After this, you have a chance to either raise or lower the quality of the material a second time during the “Refining Process” (see Refining Materials below). After the refining process is complete, the material’s quality is set and it changes from CR level, to “Item Quality”. This material is now ready to be combined with any other refined materials and made into a weapon.

Consider the first stage of a freshly salvaged material to be equivalent to freshly mined iron ore. You then refine that ore and smelt it down into ingots at a forge, and shape it into the correct shape for the weapon or armor. In some cases this might be the raw blade itself of a sword, without its grip, pommel or guard. In another case it may be the breastplate, before leather straps or other details are affixed to it. 

Once a weapon or piece of armor is complete, by combining all of the refined materials together for it, it gains an item quality equal to the combined item quality of each refined material used to make it. 

  

## Refining Materials

Before a material is forged into a weapon or piece of armor, it needs to be refined. This can involve smelting it down, curing it, or simply shaping it into something more practical. This step takes place just before the final item is created, but is still considered part of the crafting process. During the refining process, if a material is refined at an inappropriate workshop, the final “Item Quality” of that material might be lowered. 

Below is a list of which tier of workshop is needed to refine a material of a certain CR level. Keep in mind that certain creature types might not ever be able to be refined at just any forge, despite their CR level. This will be noted in the monster material’s “Blueprints”. For example, as previously mentioned, materials from Fiends could never be refined in a common workshop. 

If a material that requires a higher tier of workshop to forge it, is made at a lower tier workshop, the final “Item Quality” of the refined material will be lowered by the amount mentioned in the table below. Alternatively, any material refined at a workshop of a higher tier than that material needs, will have its item quality raised by the amount mentioned in the table below, based on the tier of workshop it was refined at. 

When a material is refined, it gains the properties from the “Monster Material Blueprint” table equal to the material’s CR Level, after any bonuses are added or subtracted from the workshop it is refined at. When this material is used to create a weapon or armor, that weapon or armor will gain the property of this refined material. 

Once a material is refined, it gains a set “item quality” equal to the final CR level it had once refined. This “item quality” cannot be changed.

However, if this part of the weapon is reforged into a new shape for any reason, it can only be done so at a workshop with a tier equal to or lower than the workshop it was refined at. When this is done, the properties of the material remain the same.

  

## CR of Material 

| Forge Type | Bonuses Added or Subtracted from Material’s CR Level |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| CR of Material | 1-5 | 6-10 | 11-15       | 16-19       | 20+         |
| -------------- | --- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Common         | 0   | -2   | Unrefinable | Unrefinable | Unrefinable |
| Uncommon       | +1  | 0    | -3          | Unrefinable | Unrefinable |
| Rare           | +2  | +1   | 0           | -5          | Unrefinable |
| Very Rare      | +3  | +2   | +1          | 0           | -10         |
| Legendary      | +5  | +4   | +3          | +1          | 0           |


*Anything listed as “unrefinable” cannot be refined at this tier of forge.

  

### Samples of Forges

It might be hard to imagine what each tier of forge mentioned above might look like, and so I have given some examples below for each tier of forge.

  

#### Common

This is just your every day, run of the mill forge. There is nothing magical or unique about it in any way. It has your standard furnace anvil and a few tools, and that’s about it. It might not even have an anvil! Maybe there’s just a lump of stone that you work on.

  

#### Uncommon

Uncommon workshops are not typically magical in any way, but they are a cut above most. These establishments have typically had a lot of money put into them to ensure they can produce good quality equipment. You might find a king, queen or other lord’s blacksmith tending to one of these just within the castle walls.

In bigger cities, some of the high end blacksmiths might have worked up enough gold in their lifetime to upgrade their workspace to something of this quality.

  

#### Rare

These are the first forges to have something magical going on with them. These workshops typically have just one central magical effect taking place within an otherwise, simple enough looking forge. Such magical effects could be a series of small arcane glyphs carved into the stones of the forge. Perhaps the fire of an elemental or spirit heats this forge. It may have been blessed by a minor deity or perhaps the location itself in which the forge was built was somewhat magical in nature. 

These forges might have legends or folktales associated with them, and many can be found on the outskirts of civilization, or are kept secret so as not to have anyone tarnish their magic. Consider making the discovery of or journey to this forge a minor quest of sorts for your players. Have them travel to a unique location (ideally connected to your overarching story and you really want your players to go here, but haven't been able to hook them in yet). 

  

#### Very Rare

These are the true works of fantasy. An ancient workshop found in the ancient cities of a long forgotten elven kingdom. A grim forge found at the darkest depths of a vampire lord’s castle that has been made from the fossilized blood of a hundred thousand victims. The fires of “Mount Doom”. 

Most of these workshops will typically be found on the material plane, but this does not diminish their awesome power. These forges would not only be capable enough of forging high quality materials, but consider having them grant boons or even sentience to the items forged at them. Perhaps a soul bond has to be made with the item you forge here; sacrificing a part of yourself, so as to give life to this ring of power.  
  

#### Legendary

This is a forge you can build an entire campaign around. Have this location be a place lost in the stars that the party must journey to in order to fuse the heart of a dying angel into the bones of titan in order to create a weapon strong enough to fell a new born god. 

These forges burn with the power of a dying star, or perhaps they do not burn at all. Perhaps this forge somehow utilized the power of a blackhole and can condense and warm materials in wild ways. Maybe this workshop has been built within the ribcage of a long lost elder god and the heart at its center is what infuses materials with divine energies so as to change it into a more malleable form.

  

## Duration of the Smithing Process 

The time it takes to refine a material equals a number of hours equal to the CR Level of that material, before any bonuses are added or subtracted from the workshop it is to be refined at. This process can be shared by other creatures proficient in smithing tools, but cannot be interrupted in any way. If the process is interrupted by any means, it must be started again from the beginning.

Combining refined materials to form an item is a simple process that only takes an hour to complete, per material being added minus 1 hour, to form the item itself.

For example, if you are forming a sword from 3 refined materials (bone blade, a leather guard and a golden pommel), the process will take you 2 hours.

After each hour of work, you may rest and return to the process later, but the item will be unusable until this process is complete. 

  

## Crafting a weapon

When crafting a weapon, it can only consist of a number of refined materials equal to half of your proficiency modifier, rounded up. As you level up, you will learn how to add additional materials to an item. Any other materials used to make this weapon, such as grips and pommels will be made out of unnoteworthy materials that do not grant any additional benefits. 

  

## Altering Items

During a long rest, you always have the option to alter items you already have. This can be done using any Refined Materials you already have. It works in a similar way to forming an item. The time it takes you to alter an item is equal to 1 hour per new refined material being added to the item. Up to 1 item can be altered per long rest.

  

## Monster Material “Blueprints”

Below is a list of Blueprints for what benefit a refined material can provide that has been taken from a specific creature. These benefits are based on that material’s CR Level, which is typically the same as the CR level of the creature it was taken from. But as previously mentioned, this CR Level can vary based on how well it was harvested and the quality of the workshop it was refined at.

  

Note: The list below specifies the benefits the material provides to weapons made from this material, but armor benefits will be added in the future.
