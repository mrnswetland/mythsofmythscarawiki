*Following the arrest of the Slayers of the Coast, a summit is called by [[./Karametra|Karametra]] and [[./Nylea|Nylea]] in the Realm of the Gods ([[./Nyx|Nyx]]).

  

As the gods file into the Council Room, a sun-bronzed god in a flowing tunic begins to speak.

  

[[./Heliod|Heliod]]: “Thank you all for arriving, despite the short notice.” He looks to the 16 other gods that have now taken their seats. “Shall we begin?”

  

A motherly figure with hair made of ordered rows of leaves rises from their chair and approaches the center of the chamber.

  

Karametra: “As was relayed in the summons, four individuals were arrested this afternoon under the belief that they are responsible for the murder of Kallias of Ophis Tower, one of my and Nylea’s disciples. This is not a matter we have taken lightly, as I feel any of you would react with justified rage should a champion of yours be unjustly slain.” Her eyes scan the faces of the other gods, a few nodding in agreement. “They are to stand trial in [[./Vinerus|Vinerus]], with Nylea and myself having final say on their judgment. However,” she pauses, “ I am aware that they have had….. an impact in the domains of a few of you. What say you?”

  

Mumbles between gods echo through the vast chamber, before a voice of intent claims the attention of the room. A female-triton-like being with octopus-tentacle hair and a crown of crab legs stands from their seat.

  

[[./Thassa|Thassa]]: “I am no stranger to three of the accused. They desecrated a temple of mine near [[./Kartan|Kartan]], and slayed its defender. It would seem they are no strangers to killing the divinely appointed.”

  

A booming voice erupts from a four-horned minotaur of incredible size clad in spiked bronze armor from the far side of the room.

  

[[./Mogis|Mogis]]: “Hold up just a moment! Your ‘defender’ attacked them first. It’s only right they put the rancid fish fucker in the ground!”

  

Thassa: “EXCUSE ME?!”

  

[[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]: “ENOUGH! BOTH OF YOU!”

  

Thassa and Mogis freeze at the voice emanating from a star-filled silhouette, the only god to not materialize in physical form, before returning to their seats.

  

After a palpable moment of silence, Heliod clears his throat to break the silence.

  
Heliod: “Any others who would speak of the accused?”  
  

A warrior in gleaming armor raises their hand as they speak.

  
[[./Iroas|Iroas]]: “While I can’t believe I’m going to say this, I do somewhat agree with Mogis. The orc known as Skar-Fang is one of my devout, and though Thassa’s champion was slain by him, the champion was shown to have instigated per our previous meeting. This should have no sway on the charges currently being accused.”  
  
[[./Ephara|Ephara]]: “I second this.”

  

The eyes in the room shift to a woman in a dress of blue and white.  
  

Ephara: “Despite their tendencies to insert themselves in the worst possible times and places, it has benefitted us all. Their efforts in preventing [[./Fortuna|Fortuna]]’s return in Kartan did not go unnoticed.”

  

Several gods nod in agreement.

  

[[./Athreos|Athreos]]: “And yet one of them actively spits in the eyes of Death and Fate,” says a gaunt figure cloaked in ragged robes. “Do you not agree, [[./Klothys|Klothys]]?” he says, locking eyes with a woman with curled horns and pale hair.

  

Klothys: “The one you speak of has long since been a meddler. While his removal would greatly benefit the stability of the Loom, your disdain for this one and his benefactor clouds your judgment.”

  

Heliod: “It seems these three have quite the reputation, for better or worse. Shall we put this to a vote then? All in favor of defending the accused?”  
  
Ephara, Iroas, Mogis, [[./Phenax|Phenax]], and Purphoros raise their hands.  
  
Heliod: “And all in favor of prosecution?”  
  
Athreos, Karametra, Klothys, Nylea, and Thassa raise their hands.  
  
Heliod: “All in favor of abstaining?”

  

Heliod, [[./Erebos|Erebos]], [[./Keranos|Keranos]], Kruphix, [[./Pharika|Pharika]], [[./Shar|Shar]], [[./Sehanine and Selune|Sehanine and Selune]] raise their hands.

  

Heliod: “An even split. To court it is. Summon your representatives or prepare a vessel if you intend to witness the trial yourselves. Council adjourned.”
