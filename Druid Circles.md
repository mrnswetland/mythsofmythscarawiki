## Druid Circles

Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.

At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.

## Circle of Dreams

Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.

#### Circle of Dreams Features

|Druid Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|2nd|Balm of the Summer Court|
|6th|Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow|
|10th|Hidden Paths|
|14th|Walker in Dreams|

#### Balm of the Summer Court

At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

#### Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow

At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) and Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

#### Hidden Paths

Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Walker in Dreams

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: [dream](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2079-dream) (with you as the messenger), [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2239-scrying), or [teleportation circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-teleportation-circle).

This use of [teleportation circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-teleportation-circle) is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of Spores

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.

These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn’t the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

#### Circle of Spores Features

|Druid Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|2nd|Circle Spells, Halo of Spores, Symbiotic Entity|
|6th|Fungal Infestation|
|10th|Spreading Spores|
|14th|Fungal Body|

#### Circle Spells

_2nd-level Circle of Spores feature_

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the [chill touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2026-chill-touch) cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

##### **Circle of Spores Spells**

|Druid Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|2nd|[chill touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2026-chill-touch)|
|3rd|[blindness/deafness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2018-blindness-deafness), [gentle repose](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2121-gentle-repose)|
|5th|[animate dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1996-animate-dead), [gaseous form](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2118-gaseous-form)|
|7th|[blight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2017-blight), [confusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2038-confusion)|
|9th|[cloudkill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2030-cloudkill), [contagion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2046-contagion)|

#### Halo of Spores

_2nd-level Circle of Spores feature_

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

#### Symbiotic Entity

_2nd-level Circle of Spores feature_  
You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

> **RULE TIP: TEMPORARY HIT POINTS DON'T STACK**
> 
> If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don’t add them together, unless a rule says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep. For more information on temporary hit points, see [chapter 9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#TemporaryHitPoints "chapter 9") of the _[Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook")_.

#### Fungal Infestation

_6th-level Circle of Spores feature_

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) stat block in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie’s turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Spreading Spores

_10th-level Circle of Spores feature_

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can’t use your Halo of Spores reaction.

#### Fungal Body

_14th-level Circle of Spores feature_

The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can’t be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition), and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

## Circle of Stars Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.

Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the stars’ effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground temples— any construction durable enough to protect the circle’s sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.

#### Star Map

_2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature_

You’ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

- You know the [guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2132-guidance) cantrip.
- You have the [guiding bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt) spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
- You can cast [guiding bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt) without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.

##### Star Map

|d6|Map Form|
|---|---|
|1|A scroll covered with depictions of constellations|
|2|A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it|
|3|A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks|
|4|A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover|
|5|A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light|
|6|Glass disks that depict constellations|

#### Starry Form

_2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature_

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:

**Archer.** A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Chalice.** A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

**Dragon.** A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

#### Cosmic Omen

_6th-level Circle of the Stars feature_

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Twinkling Constellations

_10th-level Circle of the Stars feature_

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

#### Full of Stars

_14th-level Circle of the Stars feature_

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Circle of the Land Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

#### Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

#### Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Circle Spells

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land’s Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the [entangle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2085-entangle) spell.

#### Nature’s Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Nature’s Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

## Circle of the Moon Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid’s blood.

#### Combat Wild Shape

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

#### Circle Forms

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

#### Primal Strike

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Circle Forms

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

#### Elemental Wild Shape

At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an [air elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16774-air-elemental), an [earth elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16853-earth-elemental), a [fire elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16861-fire-elemental), or a [water elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17051-water-elemental).

#### Thousand Forms

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the [alter self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1992-alter-self) spell at will.

## Circle of the Shepherd

Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.

Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

#### Circle of the Shepherd Features

|Druid Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|2nd|Speech of the Woods, Spirit Totem|
|6th|Mighty Summoner|
|10th|Guardian Spirit|
|14th|Faithful Summons|

#### Speech of the Woods

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.

You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

#### Spirit Totem

Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

**Bear Spirit.** The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

**Hawk Spirit.** The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks while in the aura.

**Unicorn Spirit.** The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.

#### Mighty Summoner

Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:

- The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.
- The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Guardian Spirit

Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.

#### Faithful Summons

Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of [conjure animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2039-conjure-animals) as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of Wildfire

Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.

#### Circle Spells

_2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature_

You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

##### Circle of Wildfire Spells

#### Summon Wildfire Spirit

_2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature_

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit’s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

Actions

_**Flame Seed.** Ranged Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, range 60 ft., one target you can see. _Hit:_ 1d6 + PB fire damage.

_**Fiery Teleportation.**_ The spirit and each willing creature of your choice within 5 feet of it teleport up to 15 feet to unoccupied spaces you can see. Then each creature within 5 feet of the space that the spirit left must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 + PB fire damage.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction).

The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

#### Enhanced Bond

_6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature_

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

#### Cauterizing Flames

_10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature_

You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature’s space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Blazing Revival

_14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature_

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition), you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Circle of Shadows

Druids who belong to the Circle of Shadows embrace the primal power of darkness as the purest distillation of the natural world. While other druids might concern themselves with balance, the Circle of Shadows understands that all things eventually return to darkness, so it must be understood.

#### Umbral Form

Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a shadowy umbral form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your umbral form, you retain your statistics, but your body becomes transparent like smoke. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), die, or use this feature again.

While you are in this form, you gain the following features:

- While in dim light or darkness, you can take the [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action as a bonus action.
- You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- When a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal cold damage equal to your proficiency bonus to that creature.

#### Circle Spells

You have embraced the powers of shadow, a dark force that suffuses reality. Your connection to this energy grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Shadow Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

##### Circle of Shadows Spells

|Druid Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|2nd|[bane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2009-bane), [false life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2093-false-life)|
|3rd|[darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2058-darkness), [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2059-darkvision)|
|5th|[blink](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2019-blink), [fear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2094-fear)|
|7th|[black tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2014-black-tentacles), [greater invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2128-greater-invisibility)|
|9th|[cone of cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2037-cone-of-cold), [dream](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2079-dream)|

#### Dark Servant

At 6th level, you gain the ability to awaken shadows to do your bidding. As a bonus action, you can target a creature that you can see within 30 feet. That creature’s shadow comes to life as a separate creature under your command, using the [shadow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow) stat block.

The shadow appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target and can act immediately. The shadow acts on your initiative, it must spend its turn moving toward the target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack the target (and no action is required by you to command the shadow). If the shadow hits with an attack, instead of doing any damage, the target instead has disadvantage on the first attack or saving throw it makes before the start of the shadow’s next turn.

The shadow disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Shadow Mass

At 10th level, your Umbral Form grows in power. While in this form, you gain the following additional benefits:

- You gain a fly speed equal to your normal speed, and you can hover.
- You have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

#### Darkness Falls

At 14th level, you can use an action to emit a 15-foot radius sphere of magical darkness centered on yourself. The sphere moves with you, and its darkness spreads around corners. When you create the sphere, you can designate any number of creatures that can see through the darkness, but otherwise, a creature with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

The sphere lasts for 1 minute, until you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), or until it comes into contact with sunlight. If any of this effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 7th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Those who channel the magic of life and nature often find themselves drawn to a particular shrine or natural site, binding their body and spirit to these places of power. Such druids draw vitality from their chosen location, protecting it with their lives—but not all succeed in defending these sacred realms.

Whether through the subtle corruption of vile magics, the tainted presence of an ancient terror, or a terrible mistake unleashed by druids themselves, a land can become cursed with magic that warps any druid bound to that land. Twisted by their connection to an unhallowed territory, these guardians come to embody the defiled nature they serve, exalting the natural process of decay and using it to further their goals—or sometimes to seek a means to end the curse that plagues them.

#### Defile Ground

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this circle, you can use a bonus action to corrupt a patch of land or an area of water in a 10-foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet of you. This corruption lasts for 1 minute. The corrupted area is [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain) for creatures that are hostile to you. Additionally, when a creature in the area takes damage from an attack or spell for the first time on a turn, it takes an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. You can move this patch of corruption up to 30 feet as a bonus action. Flying creatures are unaffected by the corruption.

Starting at 10th level, the area of your defiled ground increases to a 20-foot radius. Additionally, the extra damage dealt by your defiled ground increases to 1d6 when you reach 10th level in this class, and 1d8 at 14th level.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Blighted Shape

Also at 2nd level, your physical form begins to show effects of the corruption you wield, tracing blackened veins across your skin, producing gnarled, bony protrusions, or other eerie phenomena. You gain proficiency in the Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) skill.

Additionally, while you are transformed by your Wild Shape feature, you gain a +2 bonus to AC as gnarled spines protrude from your body. Your beast form also gains [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a radius of 60 feet, or an additional 60 feet of [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) if it already has that sense.

#### Call of the Shadowseeds

At 6th level, you learn to summon the feral children of the forest from the life force of your enemies. When a creature that is not undead or a construct takes damage within the area of your Defile Ground feature, you can use your reaction to summon a blighted sapling in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature. You can direct the sapling to make an attack against any creature within 5 feet of it as a part of this reaction. The sapling then acts on your initiative, obeying your verbal commands.

The blighted sapling remains in your service until it’s reduced to 0 hit points, until the end of your next long rest, or until you summon another sapling, at which point it crumbles into foul-smelling mulch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The sapling uses the accompanying **blighted sapling** stat block. Its features scale based on your level and proficiency bonus (PB).

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 2d4 + PB piercing damage.

#### Foul Conjuration

Starting at 10th level, the creatures you conjure are malformed and bloated with toxins. Any beast, fey, or plant (including your blighted sapling) summoned or created by your spells or class features gains the following traits:

_**Blighted Resilience.**_ The creature has immunity to necrotic and poison damage and to the [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition.

_**Toxic Demise.**_ When the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a burst of toxic mulch or fetid viscera. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take necrotic damage based on the creature’s challenge rating (see the table below). As an action, you can also cause a summoned creature to explode, immediately killing it.

##### Toxic Demise Damage
|Creature CR|Damage|
|---|---|
|1/4 or lower|1d4 necrotic damage|
|1/2|1d6 necrotic damage|
|1 or higher|A number of d8s of necrotic damage equal to the creature’s challenge rating|
|No challenge rating|A number of d6s of necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus|

#### Incarnation of Corruption

At 14th level, your physical form begins to take on the tainted traits of the land you are bonded to. Your skin grows ashen, and your eyes darken or turn completely white. Spines and jagged spurs emerge from your body, granting you resistance to necrotic damage and a +2 bonus to AC.

Additionally, whenever you start your turn within the radius of the corruption created by your Defile Ground feature, you can use a bonus action to gain [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your proficiency bonus.
