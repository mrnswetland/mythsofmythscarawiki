One legend claims that [[./Mogis|Mogis]] and [[./Iroas|Iroas]] were once a single being, the act of war personified. But the inherent tension between honor and brutality in combat led to a dichotomy of purpose too great for a single god to reconcile. Ripping himself apart, the god split in two, and so did [[./Mogis|Mogis]] and [[./Iroas|Iroas]] come into existence, embodiments of the two aspects of war that are forever in conflict. Though no tales of either [[./Mogis|Mogis]] or [[./Iroas|Iroas]]â€™s faith speak of such, whispers among the servants of other gods claim that there might be a way to piece the fractured god back together. Doing so would require an incredible feat, though, likely involving the cooperation of both [[./Mogis|Mogis]] and [[./Iroas|Iroas]] themselves.
