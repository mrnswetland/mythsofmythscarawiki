## Divine Domains

In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.

Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.

Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.

## Arcana Domain

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

#### Arcana Domain Spells

|9th|[planar binding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2205-planar-binding), [teleportation circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-teleportation-circle)|

#### Arcane Initiate

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

#### Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can only use the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the [banishment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2010-banishment) spell, no concentration required) if it isn’t on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.

##### **Arcane Banishment**

|Cleric Level|Banishes Creatures of CR …|
|---|---|
|5th|1/2 or lower|
|8th|1 or lower|
|11th|2 or lower|
|14th|3 or lower|
|17th|4 or lower|

#### Spell Breaker

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Arcane Mastery

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.

## Death Domain

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel).

#### Death Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[false life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2093-false-life), [ray of sickness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2318-ray-of-sickness)|
|3rd|[blindness/deafness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2018-blindness-deafness), [ray of enfeeblement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2225-ray-of-enfeeblement)|
|5th|[animate dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1996-animate-dead), [vampiric touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2289-vampiric-touch)|

|9th|[antilife shell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1998-antilife-shell), [cloudkill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2030-cloudkill)|

#### Bonus Proficiency

When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains proficiency with martial weapons.

#### Reaper

At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

#### Channel Divinity: Touch of Death

Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature’s life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level.

#### Inescapable Destruction

Starting at 6th level, the cleric’s ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character’s cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, the cleric gains the ability to infuse his or her weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of the cleric’s turns when he or she hits a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When the cleric reaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Improved Reaper

Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must provide them for each target.

## Forge Domain

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

#### Forge Domain Features

|Cleric Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|1st|Domain Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Blessing of the Forge|
|2nd|Channel Divinity: Artisan’s Blessing|

|8th|Divine Strike (1d8)|
|14th|Divine Strike (2d8)|
|17th|Saint of Forge and Fire|

#### Domain Spells

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Forge Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### **Forge Domain Spells**

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-identify), [searing smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2319-searing-smite)|
|3rd|[heat metal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2141-heat-metal), [magic weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2178-magic-weapon)|
|5th|[elemental weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2337-elemental-weapon), [protection from energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2220-protection-from-energy)|

|9th|[animate objects](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1997-animate-objects), [creation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2055-creation)|

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith’s tools.

#### Blessing of the Forge

At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, “[Equipment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment),” in the _[Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb)_ for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

#### Soul of the Forge

Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:

- You gain resistance to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Saint of Forge and Fire

At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:

- You gain immunity to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

## Grave Domain

Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

#### Grave Domain Features

|Cleric Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|1st|Domain Spells, Circle of Mortality, Eyes of the Grave|
|2nd|Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave|
|6th|Sentinel at Death’s Door|
|8th|Potent Spellcasting|
|17th|Keeper of Souls|

#### Domain Spells

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Grave Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

#### Grave Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[bane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2009-bane), [false life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2093-false-life)|
|3rd|[gentle repose](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2121-gentle-repose), [ray of enfeeblement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2225-ray-of-enfeeblement)|
|5th|[revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2234-revivify), [vampiric touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2289-vampiric-touch)|
|7th|[blight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2017-blight), [death ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2061-death-ward)|
|9th|[antilife shell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1998-antilife-shell), [raise dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2224-raise-dead)|

#### Circle of Mortality

At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

In addition, you learn the [spare the dying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2257-spare-the-dying) cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Eyes of the Grave

At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover and that isn’t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn’t tell you anything about a creature’s capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination.

As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack’s damage, and then the curse ends.

#### Sentinel at Death’s Door

At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Keeper of Souls

Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). Once you use it, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.

## Knowledge Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The gods of knowledge — including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth — value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

#### Knowledge Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2032-command), [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-identify)|
|3rd|[augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2007-augury), [suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2269-suggestion)|
|5th|[nondetection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2199-nondetection), [speak with dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2259-speak-with-dead)|
|7th|[arcane eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2001-arcane-eye), [confusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2038-confusion)|
|9th|[legend lore](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2163-legend-lore), [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2239-scrying)|

#### Blessings of Knowledge

At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills).

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.

#### Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.

#### Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts

At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature’s mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.

If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the [suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2269-suggestion) spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Visions of the Past

Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Object Reading.** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object’s previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

**Area Reading.** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

## Life Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy — one of the fundamental forces of the universe — that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). 

#### Life Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless), [cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-cure-wounds)|

#### Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

#### Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

#### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

#### Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

## Light Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Gods of light — including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty — promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

#### Light Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[burning hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2021-burning-hands), [faerie fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2091-faerie-fire)|
|3rd|[flaming sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2108-flaming-sphere), [scorching ray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2238-scorching-ray)|
|5th|[daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2060-daylight), [fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2102-fireball)|
|7th|[guardian of faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2130-guardian-of-faith), [wall of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2291-wall-of-fire)|
|9th|[flame strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2107-flame-strike), [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2239-scrying)|

#### Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2166-light) cantrip if you don’t already know it. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

#### Warding Flare

Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

#### Improved Flare

Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Corona of Light

Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

## Nature Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

#### Acolyte of Nature

At 1st level, you learn one druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills).

#### Bonus Proficiency

Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

#### Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.

#### Dampen Elements

Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Master of Nature

At 17th level, you gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures. While creatures are [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those creatures will do on its next turn.

## Order Domain

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

##### Order Deities

|Example Deity|Pantheon|
|---|---|
|Aureon|Eberron|
|Bane|Forgotten Realms|
|Majere|Dragonlance|
|Pholtus|Greyhawk|

You can invoke the power of law to embolden an ally to attack. If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see.

If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

#### Channel Divinity: Order’s Demand

_2nd-level Order Domain feature_

You can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others.

You can also cause any of the [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

#### Embodiment of the Law

_6th-level Order Domain feature_

You have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell’s casting time is normally 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Divine Strike

_8th-level Order Domain feature_

#### Order's Wrath

_17th-level Order Domain feature_

Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.

## Peace Domain

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics’ blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another’s burdens, and the clerics’ magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

##### Peace Deities

|Example Deity|Pantheon|
|---|---|
|Angharradh|Elven|
|Berronar Truesilver|Dwarven|
|Boldrei|Eberron|

#### Emboldening Bond

_1st-level Peace Domain feature_

You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace

 _2nd-level Peace Domain feature_

You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

#### Protective Bond

_6th-level Peace Domain feature_

The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

#### Potent Spellcasting

_8th-level Peace Domain feature_

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Expansive Bond

_17th-level Peace Domain feature_

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else’s damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.

## Tempest Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain — including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor — govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

#### Tempest Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[fog cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2112-fog-cloud), [thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2278-thunderwave)|

#### Bonus Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

#### Wrath of the Storm

Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity.

When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.

#### Thunderbolt Strike

At 6th level, when you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Stormborn

At 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.

## Trickery Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Gods of trickery — such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki — are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.

#### Trickery Domain Spells

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2025-charm-person), [disguise self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2069-disguise-self)|

#### Blessing of the Trickster

Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

#### Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

#### Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish.

As an action, you become [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with poison — a gift from your deity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Improved Duplicity

At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.

## Twilight Domain

The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day’s labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.

Clerics who serve these deities—examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table—bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

##### Twilight Deities

|Boldrei|Eberron|
|Celestian|Greyhawk|

As an action, you can magically share the [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) lasts for 1 hour.

You can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates from you. The sphere is centered on you, has a 30-foot radius, and is filled with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:

- You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.
- You end one effect on it causing it to be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

## War Domain Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Guided Strike

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

Developed in Wildemount by the Claret Orders, the Blood Domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force as it exists within the body, and the divine conduit it can become. Those who take up this domain understand that the power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell.

Gods who grant the power of the Blood Domain, including the Ruiner and the Matron of Ravens, direct their followers to tap into the connection between body and soul, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and corrupt the bodies of others through the secret rites of hemocraft. Clerics of good gods use hemocraft to fill their self-sacrifice with purpose and power, while clerics with fewer morals use the blood of others to achieve their own malevolent ends.

#### Domain Spells

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Blood Domain Spells table.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

#### Bloodletting Focus

Starting at 1st level, your divine magic draws the blood from magically inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your foes. When you cast a damage-dealing spell of 1st level or higher whose duration is instantaneous, any creature with blood that takes damage from the spell takes extra necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

#### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to form a supernatural bond with a creature you can see, or with a creature for which you possess a blood sample. This bond lasts for 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

While the bond is in effect, you can use an action to learn the target’s approximate distance and direction from you, as well as its current hit points and any conditions affecting it, as long as the target is within 10 miles of you. Alternatively, you can use your action to attempt to connect with the target’s senses. You take 2d6 necrotic damage and the target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the bond ends. On a failure, you can choose to either see or hear through the target’s senses for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 minute). During this time, you are [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) or [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) (respectively) with regard to your own senses. When the connection ends, the bond is lost.

Regardless of the outcome, the target feels a wave of unease pass over it when it makes this save.

#### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature’s actions—whether that creature is living or dead. As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature or corpse within 60 feet of you that has blood. A creature you target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you. An [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) creature automatically fails its saving throw, and isn’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) while you control its actions. A corpse targeted by this effect gains a semblance of life that you control.

On the affected creature or animated corpse’s turn, you can command it (no action required) to move up to half its speed and use its action to do one of the following:

- Interact with an object
- Make a single attack
- Do nothing

An animated corpse or an [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) creature takes its turn immediately after yours, but can’t move or take actions unless you command it to do so. Its game statistics are the same as when it was alive or conscious.

An affected living creature makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For any target, your control lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

At 17th level, you can use this feature to target a Huge or smaller creature or corpse.

#### Sanguine Recall

At 6th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots as an action. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You take 1d8 necrotic damage for each spell slot level recovered, which can’t be reduced in any way. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, if you’re an 8th-level cleric, you can recover up to four levels of spell slots—a single 4th-level slot, two 2nd-level slots, a 3rd-level slot and a 1st-level slot, or four 1st-level slots. You then take 4d8 necrotic damage.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to cause the physical wounds you deal out to bleed profusely. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Vascular Corruption Aura

At 17th level, you can use your action to emit a deathly aura of necrotic energy that causes the veins of nearby foes to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any hostile creature with blood that moves within 30 feet of you for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 necrotic damage. If a hostile creature with blood regains hit points while in the aura, it regains only half as many hit points as expected.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Keeper Domain

The Keeper domain focuses on social bonds and well‑regulated communities. These communities might be as small as an adventuring party or as large as a city, but all require safety and comfort to thrive. Keeper domain clerics excel in leadership positions and are the first to take up arms when their homes or allies need protection.

#### Keeper Domain Spells

#### Blessed Chosen

Starting at 1st level, you can assert your divine will to protect your allies. When an enemy within 30 feet of you that you can see attacks one of your allies, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll before it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. You also gain proficiency in the [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill.

#### Channel Divinity: Divine Initiative

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to enhance your allies’ potential.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose a number of creatures that you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints). When a target gains these temporary hit points, they can immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack.

The number of [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 6th level, 11 at 8th level, and 14 at 17th level.

#### Fighting Fit

At 6th level, you gain the ability to shore up your allies’ reserves. As a reaction, when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition), you can remove that condition.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Hobbling Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). When you reach 14th level, the target’s speed is also halved until the start of your next turn.

#### Duty Over Death

Starting at 17th level, you can exert your power to call companions back from the brink of death. When an ally you can see within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, they instead remain conscious and regain hit points equal to half their maximum hit points. You can use this feature only if you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Since the Founding, all mortal creatures have looked to the skies and sensed the power and mystery carried by Catha and Ruidus, the two moons of Exandria. The Moonweaver herself is said to guide her worshipers from within the pale glow of Catha, revealing hidden paths and granting inspired dreams to those who pray to that moon. Distant, dark Ruidus is often regarded with awe and apprehension, considered a portent for fell deeds and bad luck.

Clerics of the Moon Domain draw on their divine connection to the moons to wield light and shadow, invoke good fortune and ill favor, and reveal or conceal as they see fit. Most Moon clerics worship the Moonweaver herself, but her followers are as varied as the stars in the sky. Some seek to protect the vulnerable and do good in the world, while others meddle with impunity and distort the truth for selfish gain. Other Moon clerics worship not the gods but the moons themselves, especially those with an innate connection to the lunar cycles through lycanthropy.

#### Domain Spells

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Moon Domain Spells table.

#### Clarity of Catha

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn to shine light upon the mind’s most dire moments, shielding those you protect. When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Blessing of the Full Moon

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse your allies with bestial power. As an action, you instill a willing creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that you can see with one of the following blessings of your choice:

_**Blessing of the Watchful Moon.**_ For 1 hour, the blessed creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks involving smell or made to track a creature.

_**Blessing of the Blood-Drenched Moon.**_ For 10 minutes, the blessed creature has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the blessed creature’s allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

#### Channel Divinity: Mind of Two Moons

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the twofold arcana of Exandria’s moons. By expending one use of Channel Divinity, you can cast a second concentration spell while already concentrating on a first spell, as long as both spells are on your list of Moon Domain spells. If you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both spells, you make the save with disadvantage. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.

#### Empowered Cantrips

Starting at 8th level, your cleric cantrips deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

#### Eclipse of Ill Omen

At 17th level, you can call upon the vermillion moon Ruidus to flare in the sky above you, eclipsing all other light. Its power surrounds you even where the sky can’t be seen, and even on other planes. As a bonus action, you can manifest an area of reddish, dim light in a 60-foot radius around you. In addition to the normal effects of dim light, creatures in the area make saving throws with disadvantage. When you create this eclipse, you can choose any number of creatures that are unaffected by it.

This eclipse lasts while you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on this feature counts as concentrating on a Moon Domain spell for the purpose of your Mind of Two Moons feature.

Additionally, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to any creatures in this area of dim light, you can curse one of those creatures until the eclipse ends (no action required). A creature cursed in this way has its speed halved and can’t regain hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Shadow Domain

The Shadow domain embraces the darkness that surrounds all things and manipulates the transitory gray that separates light from dark. Shadow domain clerics walk a subtle path, frequently changing allegiances and preferring to operate unseen.

#### Shadow Domain Spells

If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. In addition, when you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction).

#### Lengthen Shadow

Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate your own shadow to extend your reach. When you cast a cleric spell with a range of touch, your shadow can deliver the spell as if you had cast the spell. Your target must be within 15 feet of you, and you must be able to see the target. You can use this feature even if you are in an area where you cast no shadow.

When you reach 10th level in this class, your shadow can affect any target you can see within 30 feet of you.

#### Channel Divinity: Shadow Grasp

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to turn a creature’s shadow against them. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw, it is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) by its shadow until the end of your next turn. If the creature succeeds, it is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by its shadow until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature even if the target is in an area where it casts no shadow.

#### Channel Divinity: Shadow Grasp

#### Fade to Black

At 6th level, you can conceal yourself in shadow. As a bonus action when you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically become [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Army of Shadow

At 17th level, you can manipulate multiple shadows simultaneously. When you use Shadow Grasp, you can affect a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus.
