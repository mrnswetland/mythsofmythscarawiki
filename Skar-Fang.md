**Gladiator. Former orphan. Raised in an orphanage called Wayward Sons in [[./Borda|Borda]]. Grew up with a lot of prejudice—scrapper from a young age. Phantasma, a gladiator, would have stopped by boat up the coast and inspired Skar-fang to go to [[./Kartan|Kartan]], giving him the cloak of billowing before leaving.

Would have joined a few fight rings, making a rival in your first match by the name of Hektor, a [[./Human|human]] male. During his scavenging would have found a thrown-out broom. Fixed up the broom with metal, and discovered it to be a flying broom.

  

Ettin stopped Skar along the path. Defeated the ettin, and looted the gauntlets of ogre power and magic staff.

  

Luke and Ryan, two [[./Roanoin|Roanoin]] adventurers, stop Skar at the gate. They fight, ending in jovial sportsmanship and Skar joining the guild.
