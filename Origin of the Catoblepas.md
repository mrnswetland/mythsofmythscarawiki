When a herder boasted that his cattle were the finest in Mythscara because [[./Heliod|Heliod]] and [[./Nylea|Nylea]] had created them, the gods grew angry at this falsehood. [[./Heliod|Heliod]] persuaded [[./Mogis|Mogis]] to curse the cattle, transforming them into the first [[./Catoblepases|Catoblepases]]. As a result, many animal breeders prove excessively modest to this day, with humble-boasts being common and well understood among both buyers and sellers. Livestock that are “as [[./Heliod|Heliod]] intended” or “praiseless beasts” might be considered second to none.

To this day, [[./Nylea|Nylea]] offers a boon to anyone who hunts down a catoblepas and brings its head to her sacred grove.
