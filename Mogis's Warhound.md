[[./Mogis|Mogis]] generally fights alone, because he often loses control of his temper and strikes allies as well as foes in the heat of battle. Still, [[./Mogis|Mogis]] sought a creature that would go before him, instilling fear in his foes before his mighty axe fell upon them. [[./Mogis|Mogis]] took a ferocious [[Cerberus|Cerberus]] and bound it together with the fires of his eternal rage. This terrible new creation became his personal harbinger and battle companion. The god of slaughter didnâ€™t name his pet, refusing to do so until the beast had claimed a hundred thousand lives and so proved itself truly worthy of his esteem.
