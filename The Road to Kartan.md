**Heading out from [[./Roanoin|Roanoin]], the party would be leaving at the same time as Luke and Ryan who are off to [[./St. Harbor|St. Harbor]]. They are taking the east route straight to St. Harbor and would break off from the party on the second morning of travel. [[Uzar|Uzar]] is being held in manacles and is gagged in the back of their wagon. They do not recommend ungagging him, as even without his spell book the risk of innate magic is real. During the night Luke takes watch while Ryan sleeps.Â 

Uzar is withholding information. He is a sorcerer and is capable of subtle casting even when bound. When the party goes to sleep, he intends to twin suggestion charm them into releasing him. The persons he charms need to make a dc 17 save against the spell. If they fail, they attempt to release Uzar and assault Luke. If they are confronted by a conscious party member or Luke, they strike.**
