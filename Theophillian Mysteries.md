Some of [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]’s worshipers don’t identify with their inscrutable deity, but with [[./Theophilia|Theophilia]], a legendary naiad who entered [[./Nyx|Nyx]] and whose transcendent encounter with [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] each initiate strives to duplicate. The naiad’s journey is celebrated in hushed chants as blindfolded initiates are led across a boundary—often stepping into a river or over a low stone wall, an act that symbolizes crossing the horizon. Then the blindfolds are removed as the faithful intone a paean to [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]. The hope is that [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] will choose to reveal himself at the climax of the ritual, whether by the appearance of some omen or in a personal [[./Epiphany|epiphany]]. Such a revelation isn’t always positive, though, as [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] often imparts a glimpse of cosmic truths for which mortals have no possible context.
