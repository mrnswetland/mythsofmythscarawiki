Long before the [[./Elysiumite and Ruidium|Elysiumite and Ruidium]] meteor shower, the Giants as a species were united. The class system that once divided them was abolished, and they came to live upon floating cities that acted as a safe haven for all Giant-kind. With their prophetic abilities, they foresaw the collapse of civilizations during [[./Ruinam Caelo|Ruinam Caelo]], and abandoned their floating homes, disappearing from the realm as a whole. This mass exodus of the Giant race, now known as the Great Departure, consisted of 99% of the known Giant population. While occasionally a Giant can be found in the Material realm, it is an extremely rare event, and is usually due to this Giant being unaware of the original plan to depart, as they convey no information of the Giantâ€™s current whereabouts.
