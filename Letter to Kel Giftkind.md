> To Kel Giftkind,

> So if you are reading this, one of two things happened. Either I died and you opened this letter, or I didn’t die and you don’t know how to follow directions. If it’s the latter, stop reading and burn this letter immediately. If it’s the former, feel free to keep reading.
> 
> I must start this letter by saying that if you cry over me being dead I will personally not only haunt you, but as a ghost I will find a way to get to your mother and become your new dad. Do not make my death something sad. I lived a good life and if you ruin my death I’ll be pissed. That being said, I leave it to you to make sure the party keeps their spirits up, pun not intended but nevertheless meant. Since I am dead though, I no longer need stuff, so with that I leave all money in my possession to you. I also leave to you my Soul Tether Belt. I know you and your mom deal in souls, so maybe this will help with that. On the subject of souls, I do ask that you leave mine alone. Don’t make any deals or spend excessive amounts of money on bringing me back. As much as I know you guys will miss me, I am content with staying dead. And the best part about it is that regardless of what I say in this letter, you can’t say anything back. I get the last word! I could say that you like to eat horse poop, and you can’t dispute that to me, so therefore it is fact.
> 
   Jokes aside, thank you for everything. If you hadn’t been your charismatic self, we would have been stuck on several occasions. As much as I gave you crap about being a thief, part of me wishes you and I could have bonded over borderline criminal activity more. Between my perceptiveness and magical prowess and your agility and cunning, we could have made a great duo. Enough of that though. I can’t have my last words to you be a compliment, it wouldn’t sit right. So, goodbye, thank you, and you look like a bird pooped on a ram’s head.
