> If you are reading this, then I am dead and you are doing as I instructed. If I am not dead and you are reading this, I will find out. Death threats from a dead man aside, things obviously didn’t go as well as they could. While I would have preferred to continue our adventures together, fate seemed to have other plans. My only regret is that I’ll never be able to grow a beard like you. You would think that being alive for over 200 years that it would happen naturally, but I suppose not. If I died fighting, then I died properly. I always ran from problems, and to know that in the end I didn’t makes me feel content. You are a healer, and I respect that, but I do have a favor to ask. Do not resurrect me. I am okay with death, as I lived my life the best way I could. I got to see many places and people, save the world from monsters, and gained some of the best friends I could have asked for. The other letters I gave you are for my family. Do me one final favor and bring the letters to them in Nicodranis. The address is on the envelope.

> Since I am a dead man, I obviously don’t need worldly possessions. I leave you my black notebook. It is a soul bound book. Whoever writes their name in the front has their dreams recorded magically. It however wipes the contents of the book as well. It has my life recorded into it at the moment. Feel free to keep it as my memoir, or write your own name. Since I trance while you guys sleep I have noticed that you have some weird dreams. This will help you remember them. Feel free to take my spellbook as well. As the only caster in the group, you probably have the best chance of making heads or tails of it.

> If you made it this far into the letter, I again just want to say thank you for everything. We wouldn’t have made it as far as we have if you hadn’t been there. One last thing though. This letter has been pretty sappy, and that’s not really my style. I can’t have my last words to you be all emotional and all that. So in typical me fashion, I end this letter with a thanks and a good fuck you.
