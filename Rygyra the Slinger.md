[[./Iroas|Iroas]] carries a battle-worn bronze shield called the [[./Bulwark of Brotherhood|Bulwark of Brotherhood]]. It symbolizes the protective bond shared by all soldiers at war and his determination, ironically, to defeat his own brother. In the myth of [[Rygyra the Slinger|Rygyra the Slinger]], the soldier never missed when she launched stones from her magic sling. Yet, even so, her every shot bounced off the giant minotaur, [[./Raksolcs Ravage-Soul|Raksolcs Ravage-Soul]]. As the minotaur terror closed in on her, Rygyra whispered a prayer to [[./Iroas|Iroas]] and braced her flimsy wooden shield, knowing it would offer no defense against the giant’s strikes. Yet, when the blow came, the shield resounded with the barest metallic clang—like a pin falling on bronze. Opening her eyes, Rygyra discovered that her shield had transformed into a gleaming bulwark—[[./Iroas|Iroas]]’s own shield. Enraged, Raksolcs beat on the shield, leaving not even a dent. After hours of this, the minotaur collapsed, panting and exhausted. Only then did Rygyra emerge and strangle the brute with his own tongue.
