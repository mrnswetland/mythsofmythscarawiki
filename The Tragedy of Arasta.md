In ages long past, [[./Nylea|Nylea]] loved her dryad companion, [[./Arasta|Arasta]], as a sister and the two spread wonders across Mythscara. One day, [[./Phenax|Phenax]], envious of the pair and stung by some forgotten slight, transformed [[./Arasta|Arasta]] into a terrible monster to prove that the goddess’s love was based on beauty, not true kinship. Seeing the unfamiliar creature, [[./Nylea|Nylea]] was horrified and drove her away. Shattered, [[./Arasta|Arasta]] retreated and has terrorized the gods’ servants ever since. To this day, [[./Nylea|Nylea]] remains deeply pained by [[./Arasta|Arasta]]’s loss. Knowing that only [[./Phenax|Phenax]] can undo the curse he laid upon the dryad, [[./Nylea|Nylea]] often sends her champions to learn the secret of what might restore her friend.
