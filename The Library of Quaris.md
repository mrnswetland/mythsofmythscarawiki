The small town of [[./Quaris|Quaris]] boasts a remarkable library that according to local legend was a gift from [[./Ephara|Ephara]]. Other tales suggest that the library was actually founded by an ancient sage named [[./Anatheia|Anatheia]], but then a terrible fire destroyed the place, and along with it generations of collected knowledge.
