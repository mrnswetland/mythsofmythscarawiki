Once, an arrogant oracle boasted of her infallible insight, which flowed from [[./Keranos|Keranos]] himself. Bemused, the storm lord arranged for the oracle to meet a particularly cunning sphinx and engage in an epic battle of wits. The objective set forth by [[./Keranos|Keranos]] was to solve the Riddle of Lightning, an enigma devised by [[./Keranos|Keranos]] himself. After days of deliberation, the oracle realized the answer, only to be struck down by a bolt from the heavens. Among the faithful nowadays, the term “Riddle of Lightning” is used to denote a question that one is better off not knowing the answer to.
