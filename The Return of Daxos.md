[[./Daxos|Daxos]] of [[./Kartan|Kartan]] was a powerful oracle who heard the voices of all the gods. [[./Daxos|Daxos]] tragically died at the hands of his lover, the champion of [[./Heliod|Heliod]], [[./Elspeth|Elspeth]], through the duplicity of the satyr [[./Jakel|Jakel]]. [[./Daxos|Daxos]]’s soul passed into the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], and [[./Elspeth|Elspeth]] sought [[./Erebos|Erebos]]’s help to travel into [[./Nyx|Nyx]]. After passing [[./Erebos|Erebos]]’s test for admittance, [[./Elspeth|Elspeth]] demanded an additional reward: she would trade her life for [[./Daxos|Daxos]]’s. [[./Erebos|Erebos]], always eager to claim a champion of the sun god, agreed. [[./Elspeth|Elspeth]] died shortly after her triumph over Xenagos, whereupon [[./Erebos|Erebos]] kept his word—but in a treacherous fashion, allowing [[./Daxos|Daxos]]’s body to go back to the mortal world as a [[./Returned|Returned]]. Bereft of memories, he wanders aimlessly.
