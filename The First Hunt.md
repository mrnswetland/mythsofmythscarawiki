Each spring, communities observe the festival of the First Hunt, the [[./Protokynion|Protokynion]]. In ancient times, the festival involved hunting, but in the modern form of observance, it is a day of picnics, outdoor games, and frolicking that has little to do with [[./Nylea|Nylea]] except that it celebrates the full flowering of spring. Tales tell of [[./Nylea|Nylea]] being passingly bitter about the celebration and, annually, visiting a First Hunt celebration in disguise. If she finds herself duly honored during the revelry, she blesses the event and might personally participate. If she finds no mention of her works, she curses those in attendance, sometimes sending rampaging beasts to disrupt the event or turning participants into game animals for true hunters to stalk.
