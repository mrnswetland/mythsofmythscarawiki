> The soldiers arrived. Their intentions are pretty clear — the captain seems genuine, but their presence still makes me nervous. The soldiers seemed very excited when I mentioned food, booze and cards. I’ll handle them for as long as it takes. We’ll be here for the next 3 months and that’s plenty of time to warm them up. Can’t imagine any Xhorhassian spies coming this way through such heavy snow.

I would suspect mom of pulling a prank on me if I didn’t know that she would never do something so blatantly ridiculous. What are they doi

> It’s fine. Everything’s fine. Had to part ways with the captain. For the first time his departure seemed… pragmatic. A means to an end. Think I’ve heard his voice when I stopped to catch a breath. Didn’t expect him to get stuck in my mind so much.

> The message was sent. Have some “free” time? Someone going by the name Lady Nina needs help with her sick children. Sounds like in true Empire fashion, the boons of collective hard work are getting lost in the branches of genealogical trees. Will need allies. Maybe those weirdos will want to join? That military guy seems even more sketchy than me and the others are either completely nuts or just nuts enough to agree.

> Great Glasya, this was so crazy. The sheriff is definitely an asshole, but K seems to think he is hiding his true nature. Got myself a giant coffee bean (why not) and went exploring. Fell for a false floor. Illusions saved me. As if it wasn’t embarrassing enough, mom called while I was in the pit. Seems like this castle is very sketch. And to think that yesterday the task seemed so straightforward. Luckily I got back safely. Considering how hard it was to convince these people that I should go explore… that would’ve been the end of our “partnership”.

> I seem to be dreaming awake. Even now I can hear voices — wailing, pleading. Must be the lack of sleep. Got myself another bean, but eating it feels like a bad idea. Sheriff seems to be hellbent on finding his daughter (who btw is Lady Nina) and… killing her I think? I can barely pay attention. The voices are so loud. Need to get out of here, get a good sleep and find Lady Nina. At least others are in agreement and aren’t arguing. Well, not anymore.
