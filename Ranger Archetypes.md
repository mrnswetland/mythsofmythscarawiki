## Ranger Archetypes

The ideal of the ranger has classic expressions. These are detailed below.

## Beast Master Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the wild. United in focus, beast and ranger fight the monsters that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike.

#### Ranger’s Companion

At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction), [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction), [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction), or [Help](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HelpAction) action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action.

If you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.

#### Exceptional Training

Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction), [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction), or [Help](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HelpAction) action on its turn.

In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Bestial Fury

Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.

#### Share Spells

Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

## Drakewarden

Your connection to the natural world takes the form of a draconic spirit, which can manifest in physical form as a drake. As your powers grow, your drake grows as well, blossoming from a small four-legged companion to a majestic winged creature large and strong enough for you to ride. Along the way, you gain an increasing share of the awe-inspiring power of dragons.

Consider the source of the draconic spirit you have bonded with. The Drakewarden Origin table offers examples.

##### Drakewarden Origin

|d6|Origin|
|---|---|
|1|You studied a dragon’s scale or claw, or a trinket from a dragon’s hoard, creating your bond through that token’s lingering draconic magic.|
|2|A secret order of rangers who collect and guard draconic lore taught you their ways.|
|3|A dragon gave you a geode or gemstone to care for. To your surprise, the drake hatched from that stone.|
|4|You ingested a few drops of dragon blood, forever infusing your nature magic with draconic power.|
|5|An ancient Draconic inscription on a standing stone empowered you when you read it aloud.|
|6|You had a vivid dream of a mysterious figure accompanied by seven yellow canaries, who warned you of impending doom. When you awoke, your drake was there, watching you.|

#### Draconic Gift

_3rd-Level Drakewarden Feature_

The bond you share with your drake creates a connection to dragonkind, granting you understanding and empowering your presence. You gain the following benefits:

**Thaumaturgy.** You learn the [thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2277-thaumaturgy) cantrip, which is a ranger spell for you.

**Tongue of Dragons.** You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.

#### Drake Companion

_3rd-Level Drakewarden Feature_

As an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.

The drake is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), the drake can take any action of its choice, not just [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction).

The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.

Once you summon the drake, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.

#### Bond of Fang and Scale

_7th-Level Drakewarden Feature_

The bond you share with your drake intensifies, protecting you and stoking the drake’s fury. When you summon your drake, it grows wings on its back and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.

In addition, while your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:

**Drake Mount.** The drake grows to Medium size. Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount if your size is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it can’t use the flying speed of this feature.

**Magic Fang.** The drake’s Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for the drake’s Draconic Essence.

**Resistance.** You gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drake’s Draconic Essence.

#### Drake’s Breath

_11th-Level Drakewarden Feature_

As an action, you can exhale a 30-foot cone of damaging breath or cause your drake to exhale it. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice doesn’t have to match your drake’s Draconic Essence). Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

This damage increases to 10d6 when you reach 15th level in this class.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.

#### Perfected Bond

_15th-Level Drakewarden Feature_

Your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. While your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:

**Empowered Bite.** The drake’s Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence (for a total of 2d6 extra damage).

**Large Drake.** The drake grows to Large size. When you ride your drake, it is no longer prohibited from using the flying speed of Bond of Fang and Scale.

**Reflexive Resistance.** When either you or the drake takes damage while you’re within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Fey Wanderer Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

#### Dreadful Strikes

_3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature_

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn.

The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.

#### Fey Wanderer Magic

_3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature_

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Fey Wanderer Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

##### Fey Wanderer Spells

|Ranger Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|3rd|[charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2025-charm-person)|
|5th|[misty step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-misty-step)|
|9th|[dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic)|
|13th|[dimension door](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2068-dimension-door)|
|17th|[mislead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2194-mislead)|

You also possess a preternatural blessing from a fey ally or a place of fey power. Choose your blessing from the Feywild Gifts table or determine it randomly.

##### Feywild Gifts

|d6|Appearance|
|---|---|
|1|Illusory butterflies flutter around you while you take a short or long rest.|
|2|Fresh, seasonal flowers sprout from your hair each dawn.|
|3|You faintly smell of cinnamon, lavender, nutmeg, or another comforting herb or spice.|
|4|Your shadow dances while no one is looking directly at it.|
|5|Horns or antlers sprout from your head.|
|6|Your skin and hair change color to match the season at each dawn.|

#### Otherworldly Glamour

_3rd-level Fey Wanderer feature_

Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills).

#### Beguiling Twist

_7th-level Fey Wanderer feature_

The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

In addition, whenever you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can use your reaction to force a different creature you can see within 120 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the save fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### Fey Reinforcements

_11th-level Fey Wanderer feature_

The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know [summon fey](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/721204-summon-fey) (a spell in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/magical-miscellany#SummonFey "chapter 3")). It doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

#### Misty Wanderer

_15th-level Fey Wanderer feature_

You can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye: you can cast [misty step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-misty-step) without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you cast misty step, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.

## Gloom Stalker Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.

#### Gloom Stalker Features

|Ranger Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Gloom Stalker Magic, Dread Ambusher, Umbral Sight|
|7th|Iron Mind|
|11th|Stalker’s Flurry|
|15th|Shadowy Dodge|

#### Gloom Stalker Magic

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

#### Gloom Stalker Spells

|Ranger Level|Spell|

#### Dread Ambusher

At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon’s damage type.

#### Umbral Sight

At 3rd level, you gain [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision). While in darkness, you are [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) to any creature that relies on [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) to see you in that darkness.

#### Iron Mind

By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

#### Stalker’s Flurry

At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.

#### Shadowy Dodge

Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn’t have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

## Horizon Walker

Horizon Walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse — especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals — that work to preserve life and the order of the planes.

#### Horizon Walker Features

|Ranger Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Horizon Walker Magic, Detect Portal, Planar Warrior (1d8)|

#### Detect Portal

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically sense the presence of a planar portal. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

See the “[Planar Travel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#PlanarTravel "Planar Travel")” section in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for examples of planar portals.

#### Planar Warrior

At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks.

As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Ethereal Step

At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the [etherealness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2087-etherealness) spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Distant Strike

At 11th level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in the blink of an eye. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.

If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.

#### Spectral Defense

At 15th level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack’s damage on this turn.

## Hunter Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between the people you protect and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

#### Hunter’s Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Colossus Slayer

Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

##### Giant Killer

When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

##### Horde Breaker

Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

You have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

#### Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Volley

##### Whirlwind Attack

You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Superior Hunter’s Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a [lightning bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt) spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### Stand Against the Tide

When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

##### Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

## Monster Slayer

You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.

#### Monster Slayer Features

|Ranger Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Monster Slayer Magic, Hunter’s Sense, Slayer’s Prey|
|7th|Supernatural Defense|
|11th|Magic-User’s Nemesis|
|15th|Slayer’s Counter|

#### Monster Slayer Magic

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Monster Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

#### Monster Slayer Spells

|Ranger Level|Spell|
|---|---|
|3rd|[protection from evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good)|
|5th|[zone of truth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2305-zone-of-truth)|
|9th|[magic circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2174-magic-circle)|
|13th|[banishment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2010-banishment)|
|17th|[hold monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2146-hold-monster)|

#### Hunter’s Sense

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Slayer’s Prey

Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.

#### Supernatural Defense

At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target’s grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.

#### Magic-User’s Nemesis

At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else’s magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Slayer’s Counter

At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

## Swarmkeeper

Feeling a deep connection to the environment around them, some rangers reach out through their magical connection to the world and bond with a swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.

> A Swarmkeeper’s swarm and spells are reflections of the character’s bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger’s magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts [gaseous form](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2118-gaseous-form), they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the [arcane eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2001-arcane-eye) spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don’t change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character’s narrative through their class abilities.

#### Gathered Swarm

_3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature_

A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While you’re alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance, or you generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance table.

##### Swarm Appearance

|d4|Appearance|
|---|---|
|1|Swarming insects|
|2|Miniature twig blights|
|3|Fluttering birds|
|4|Playful pixies|

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:

- The attack’s target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm.
- The attack’s target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.
- You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.

#### Swarmkeeper Magic

_3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature_

You learn the [mage hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) cantrip if you don’t already know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form of your swarming nature spirits.

You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

#### Writhing Tide

_7th-level Swarmkeeper feature_

You can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Mighty Swarm

_11th-level Swarmkeeper feature_

Your Gathered Swarm grows mightier in the following ways:

- The damage of Gathered Swarm increases to 1d8.
- If a creature fails its saving throw against being moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause the swarm to knock the creature [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).
- When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives you half cover until the start of your next turn.

#### Swarming Dispersal

_15th-level Swarmkeeper feature_

You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding danger. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage. You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
