## Primal Paths

Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.

## Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

#### Path of the Ancestral Guardian Features

|Barbarian Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Ancestral Protectors|
|6th|Spirit Shield (2d6)|
|10th|Consult the Spirits, Spirit Shield (3d6)|
|14th|Vengeful Ancestors, Spirit Shield (4d6)|

#### Ancestral Protectors

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

#### Spirit Shield

Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.

#### Consult the Spirits

At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the [augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2007-augury) or [clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2028-clairvoyance) spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of [clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2028-clairvoyance) invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Vengeful Ancestors

At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

## Path of the Battlerager

Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot”) in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

#### Restriction: Dwarves Only

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM’s setting or your DM’s version of the Realms.

#### Battlerager Armor

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor (see the “Spiked Armor” sidebar) as a weapon.

While you are wearing [spiked armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/19-spiked-armor) and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.

> **SPIKED ARMOR**
> 
> Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.  
> **Cost:** 75 gp  
> **AC:** 14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)  
> **Stealth:** Disadvantage   
> **Weight:** 45 lb.

#### Reckless Abandon

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

#### Battlerager Charge

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a bonus action while you are raging.

#### Spiked Retribution

Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), and are wearing spiked armor.

## Path of the Beast

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.

Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

##### Origin of the Beast

|d4|Origin|
|---|---|
|1|One of your parents is a lycanthrope, and you’ve inherited some of their curse.|
|2|You are descended from an archdruid and inherited the ability to partially change shape.|
|3|A fey spirit gifted you with the ability to adopt different bestial aspects.|
|4|An ancient animal spirit dwells within you, allowing you to walk this path.|

#### Form of the Beast

_3rd-level Path of the Beast feature_

When you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.

You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage:

**Bite.** Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.

**Claws.** Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.

**Tail.** You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the [reach](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Reach) property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

#### Bestial Soul

_6th-level Path of the Beast feature_

The feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:

##### Climbing

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

##### Jumping

When you jump, you can make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.

##### Swimming

You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.

#### Infectious Fury

_10th-level Path of the Beast feature_

When you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):

- The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
- The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Call the Hunt

_14th-level Path of the Beast feature_

The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can each use the following benefit once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the damage equal to the number rolled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Path of the Berserker Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Path of the Giant

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Giant draw strength from the same primal forces as giants. As they rage, these barbarians surge with elemental power and grow in size, taking on forms that evoke the glory of giants. Some barbarians look like oversized versions of themselves, perhaps with a hint of elemental energy flaring in their eyes and around their weapons. Others transform more dramatically, taking on the appearance of an actual giant or a form similar to an Elemental, wreathed in fire, frost, or lightning.

#### Giant’s Power

_3rd-Level Path of the Giant Feature_

When you choose this path, you learn to speak, read, and write Giant or one other language of your choice if you already know Giant. Additionally, you learn a cantrip of your choice: either [druidcraft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2080-druidcraft) or [thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2277-thaumaturgy). Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Giant’s Havoc

_3rd-Level Path of the Giant Feature_

Your rages pull strength from the primal might of giants, transforming you into a hulking force of destruction. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

**Crushing Throw.** When you make a successful ranged attack with a thrown weapon using Strength, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the attack’s damage roll.

**Giant Stature.** Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn’t enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn’t change.

#### Elemental Cleaver

_6th-Level Path of the Giant Feature_

Your bond with the elemental might of giants grows, and you learn to infuse weapons with primordial energy.

When you enter your rage, you can choose one weapon that you are holding and infuse it with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning. While you wield the infused weapon during your rage, the weapon’s damage type changes to the chosen type, it deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type when it hits, and it gains the [thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you throw the weapon, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target. The infused weapon’s benefits are suppressed while a creature other than you wields it.

While raging and holding the infused weapon, you can use a bonus action to change the infused weapon’s current damage type to another one from the damage type options above.

#### Mighty Impel

_10th-Level Path of the Giant Feature_

Your connection to giant strength allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.

If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn’t on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).

#### Demiurgic Colossus

_14th-Level Path of the Giant Feature_

The primordial power of your rage intensifies. When you rage, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you can use your Mighty Impel to move creatures that are Large or smaller.

In addition, the extra damage dealt by your Elemental Cleaver feature increases to 2d6.

## Path of the Storm Herald

All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

Path of the Storm Herald Features
|Barbarian Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Storm Aura|
|6th|Storm Soul|
|10th|Shielding Storm|
|14th|Raging Storm|

#### Storm Aura

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

##### Desert

When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

##### Sea

When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

##### Tundra

When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.

#### Storm Soul

At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

##### Desert

You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

##### Sea

You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.

##### Tundra

You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.

#### Shielding Storm

At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

#### Raging Storm

At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

##### Desert

Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.

##### Sea

When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

##### Tundra

Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

## Path of the Totem Warrior Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

In some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

#### Spirit Seeker

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the [beast sense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2325-beast-sense) and [speak with animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals) spells, but only as rituals, as described in the [Spellcasting](http://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spellcasting#Rituals "Rituals") section.

#### Totem Spirit

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

##### Bear

While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

##### Eagle

While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.

##### Elk

While you are raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.

##### Tiger

While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.

##### Wolf

While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

#### Aspect of the Beast

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.

##### Bear

You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

##### Eagle

You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

##### Elk

Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they’re within 60 feet of you and you’re not [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) (see “[Adventuring](http://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#TravelPace),” for rules on travel pace). The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.

##### Tiger

You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), and [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.

##### Wolf

You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see “[Adventuring](http://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#TravelPace),” for rules on travel pace).

#### Spirit Walker

At 10th level, you can cast the [commune with nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2034-commune-with-nature) spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

#### Totemic Attunement

At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

##### Bear

While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

##### Eagle

While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

##### Elk

While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.

##### Tiger

While you’re raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.

##### Wolf

While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

## Path of the Zealot Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots — warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.

A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

#### Path of the Zealot Features

|Barbarian Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|3rd|Divine Fury, Warrior of the Gods|
|6th|Fanatical Focus|
|10th|Zealous Presence|
|14th|Rage beyond Death|

#### Divine Fury

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you’re raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

#### Warrior of the Gods

At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as [raise dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2224-raise-dead), has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.

#### Fanatical Focus

Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you’re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

#### Zealous Presence

At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Rage beyond Death

Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you’re raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition). You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

## Path of Wild Magic

Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

#### Magic Awareness

_3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature_

As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Wild Surge

_3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature_

The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced.

If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

##### Wild Magic

|d8|Effect|

#### Bolstering Magic

_6th-level Path of Wild Magic feature_

You can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:

- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll.
- Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature’s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can’t receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Unstable Backlash

_10th-level Path of Wild Magic feature_

When you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out; immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use your reaction to roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.

#### Controlled Surge

_14th-level Path of Wild Magic feature_

Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

> **This is Partnered Content**

Barbarians who follow the Path of the Juggernaut stand so resolutely that none can deter them, and they swing their weapons with such force that all who stand against them are flung aside. In might and in spirit, juggernauts are immovable object and unstoppable force all at once.

Juggernaut barbarians can be found all over Tal’Dorei, and are common among the goliath warriors of the Rivermaw herd that wanders the Dividing Plains. Some dwarves and humanoid survivalists of the Cliffkeep Mountains adopt this fighting style as an extension of their rugged determinism. And a number of stalwart juggernauts hail from the jungles of the Rifenmist Peninsula, having cast off the oppressive yoke of the Iron Authority.

#### Thunderous Blows

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage instills you with the strength to shove and smash your way through your foes, making any battlefield your domain. When you hit a creature with a melee attack while you’re raging, you can push that creature up to 5 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. A creature that is Huge or larger makes a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a success, the creature is not pushed.

Starting at 10th level, you can push a creature up to 10 feet when you hit it with a melee attack while you’re raging.

#### Spirit of the Mountain

At 3rd level, you harness your fury to anchor your feet to the ground, becoming a bulwark of strength. While you are raging, you can’t be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) or moved along the ground against your will.

#### Demolishing Might

Starting at 6th level, your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d8 damage to constructs, and deal double damage to objects and structures.

#### Resolute Stance

Also at 6th level, you can temporarily refocus your combat ability to make yourself a bulwark of defense. At the start of your turn (no action required), you can assume a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in this stance, you can’t be [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition), attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and your weapon attacks are made with disadvantage.

#### Hurricane Strike

Starting at 10th level, your blows can hurl foes through the air and into the attacks of your allies. As a reaction when you push a creature at least 5 feet, you can then leap into an unoccupied space next to the creature. If you do so, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). This leap costs no movement and does not provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

Additionally, whenever you push a creature into a space within 5 feet of one of your allies, the ally can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### Unstoppable

At 14th level, your fury in battle makes you unstoppable. While you’re raging, your speed cannot be reduced, and you are immune to the [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition), and [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) conditions.

If you are [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition), you can still use a bonus action to enter a rage (even if you can’t otherwise take actions). You aren’t affected by any of these conditions while you’re raging.

## Shadow Gnawer

Dark energy infuses the Shadow Realm, corrupting and corroding everything it touches. Some barbarians intentionally consume this raw shadow, infusing their bodies with shadow energy to manifest potent magical abilities.

Many of the barbarians who walk this path do so to absorb harmful shadow magic into themselves in order to protect others from its influence. A smaller group consumes shadow simply because they cannot resist its ever-present temptation.

#### Shadow Smoke

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate tendrils of shadow smoke while you rage. The smoke extends 10 feet from you in every direction. Any creature (other than you) that starts its turn in the smoke has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

#### Creeping Fog

Starting at 6th level, you can burst into a mist of raw shadow and then reassemble yourself somewhere else. As an action, you magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one melee attack.

#### Consume Darkness

At 10th level, while raging, you can feed on the shadows around you to restore your vitality. While in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d12 + your Constitution modifier. For the duration of your rage (up to 1 minute), you regain 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Corrosive Haze

At 14th level, your Shadow Smoke is more potent. Any hostile creature that enters the smoke or starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) until the beginning of its next turn. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Creatures that don’t rely on eyesight are immune to this effect.
