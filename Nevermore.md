> "Raven can you hear me 
> Thought you loved me but you fooled me 
> You drove me to madness 
> No one here to witness 
> Vicious and relentless 
> A villain in a black dress 
> Too late, I should have listened 
> You want me to be alone 
> Remind me of what is gone 
> Singing from dusk 'til dawn 
> Nevermore, nevermore, nevermore"
