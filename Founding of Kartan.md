The city-state of [[./Kartan|Kartan]] was once part of the archon [[./Agnomakhos|Agnomakhos]]’s empire. The archon ruled his territory with absolute cruelty. [[./Ephara|Ephara]] bestowed her magic on the subjugated populace to enable them to fight back and overthrow [[./Agnomakhos|Agnomakhos]]. The newly freed people then established [[./Kartan|Kartan]], as the settlement on that site is known today. The founding of [[./Ephara|Ephara]]’s favored city is still celebrated today, both in [[./Kartan|Kartan]] and elsewhere among the god’s followers, as the summer holiday of Harvestide.
