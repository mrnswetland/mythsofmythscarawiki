After a life in [[./Heliod|Heliod]]’s service, the aged oracle [[./Solsemon|Solsemon]] departed on a final pilgrimage: setting forth to visit the sun. Day after day he journeyed east, seeking the lands from which the sun rose. He journeyed far and was mocked everywhere people learned of his quest. Worse, his sight grew ever weaker as he spent days staring at the sun. Yet still he traveled on. Even when blindness claimed [[./Solsemon|Solsemon]]’s sight, the oracle continued undaunted. Finally, one day, [[./Solsemon|Solsemon]] found a warm, calm place. There, a powerful voice he’d heard in his dreams welcomed him to his journey’s end. Praising [[./Heliod|Heliod]], the oracle took his rest, and after several long, contented hours, peacefully died. Ever since, the tale of [[./Solsemon|Solsemon]] has been argued as both a parable of determination and a warning not to pursue that which is divine.
