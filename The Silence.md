When the squabbling of the gods threatened the world once more despite [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]’s warning, he etched all their names—including his own—in the bark of his great tree at the edge of the world. Immediately, the gods’ oracles could no longer hear them, their blessings faded, and the night sky held only unmoving stars. The great Silence of the gods serves as the backdrop for numerous tales of heroism and sacrifice. Many alive centuries ago witnessed the sky go dark and the temples grow quiet. Most consider the Silence a terrible mistake that led to the rise of the god [[./Jakel|Jakel]], but followers of [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] know that it was a grim necessity to prevent far worse calamity.
