## God of the Hunt
Nylea is the wild, carefree god of the hunt. She claims dominion over the whole of the natural world, particularly hunger and predation, the seasons, metamorphosis and rebirth, and the forest.

Nylea is among the most gregarious of the gods, and can be spotted frolicking joyfully with her [[./Nyxborn|Nyxborn]] [[./lynx|lynx]], [[./Halma|Halma]], or her favorite nymph, [[./Theophilia|Theophilia]]. But she also savors solitude, and on the hunt she is deadly serious, almost animalistic, in her mood. She is nearly as quick to anger as her brother [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]], enacting swift revenge on those who harm the natural realm.

Nylea usually appears as a green-skinned dryad with woody extremities. Her hair is made of vines and leaves that change with the seasons. She might also appear as a majestic specimen of any animal, most frequently a [[./lynx|lynx]] or a wolf. When she desires [[./Stealth|stealth]] or solitude, she might take the form of a tree, usually an oak or an olive.

## Nylea's Influence
Nylea is worshiped by hunters, but her concerns go far beyond humanity’s ability to subsist on the bounty of the natural world. She controls the turning of the seasons. Usually, she ushers each one in and out on schedule, but when angered, she might refuse to change to the next season, or even call upon one out of its proper time. Mortals pray to her to ward off unseasonable weather, both natural and supernatural in origin.

Nylea is the best archer in the world, and contests of archery are often held in her name. Those who hunt their own food pray to Nylea for success, and Nylea blesses their natural predation. Poachers and those who kill for sport, however, know that she loathes such activity, and they try to stay hidden from her at all costs. Nylea has personally slain many of those who killed wantonly in her sacred [[./Nessian Wood|Nessian Wood]].

Nylea’s association with metamorphosis makes her the target of prayers from those who seek to dramatically change their own [[./Nature|nature]] or identity. She is worshiped by those who want to reform or transform society in ways less violent than those favored by gods such as [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]] and [[./Mogis|Mogis]]. She is also revered by those who cherish the solitude and serenity of the forest.

Birth falls under Nylea’s influence as well, and her priests often double as midwives in their communities, blessing babies as they come into the world.

#### Nylea's Goals
Compared to the other gods, Nylea’s goals are modest. She wants only to keep the natural world free and healthy, shepherd the seasons through their yearly cycle, and enjoy the beauty of the land. But in her darker moments, she realizes that the very existence of civilization on Theros is a mounting threat to [[./Nature|nature]]—perhaps even an effort by the rest of the pantheon to destroy her. If it were up to her, she might well wipe away all the poleis and larger communities, leaving only scattered tribes of mortals to live in an enforced balance with [[./Nature|nature]]. She isn’t out to eradicate sapient beings, blaming her fellow gods for the spread of civilization rather than the mortals themselves.

#### Divine Relationships
Nylea seldom comes into open conflict with the other gods, and she would say that all her clashes with them result from their encroachment on her territory. The most frequent targets of her irritation are the gods who encourage the spread of civilization. [[./Heliod|Heliod]] and [[./Ephara|Ephara]] brought law and ambition to mortals, persuading them to congregate in stone-walled cities and consider themselves separate from her realm.

[[./Purphoros|Purphoros]] oversees some of the natural processes of earth and fire that help Nylea’s realm flourish, but he also gave mortals the gift of bronze, enabling them to make axes and spears. In both his destructive and creative guises, [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]] might threaten what Nylea holds dear. As a result, she remains wary of his designs.

Nylea is disappointed in [[./Karametra|Karametra]], precisely because of the overlap in their spheres of influence. [[./Karametra|Karametra]] insists on transforming [[./Nature|nature]] into a mockery of itself, yoking once-wild beasts and contorting plants through agriculture to feed the ever-swelling population centers.

[[./Iroas|Iroas]] and [[./Mogis|Mogis]] are harbingers of warfare, which is always devastating to the natural world. Nylea is virtually incapable of distinguishing between the “noble” and “brutal” aspects of their shared bailiwick, considering all forms of war a senseless waste of life and energy.

Nylea acknowledges death as a crucial part of the life cycle, but scorns [[./Erebos|Erebos]]’s obsession with the afterlife. What matters is that [[./Nature|nature]] takes nourishment from the bodies of the deceased, not from the disposition of their intangible souls. She blames [[./Erebos|Erebos]], [[./Athreos|Athreos]], and [[./Phenax|Phenax]] in equal measure for the existence of the [[./Returned|Returned]], which she considers abominations.

## Worshipping Nylea
Mortals all over [[Mythscara|Mythscara]] pray to Nylea when they rely on hunting or [[./Nature|nature]]’s whims for their livelihood. Her most ardent followers are satyrs, centaurs, humans (particularly those who live in [[./Gulveg|Gulveg]] and in the wilds), and nymphs of all kinds, especially dryads. Few [[./Leonin|Leonin]] worship any of the gods, but of those who do, many favor Nylea with their prayers.

Nylea blesses those who are kind to animals, considering such acts as wordless prayers. Those who must kill a dangerous natural animal or cut down trees often pray to Nylea for forgiveness, sometimes leaving food for other animals or planting new trees as atonement.

## Myths of Nylea
Most of the myths about Nylea are cautionary tales about the fate of mortals who profane her sacred forests.

#### [[./The First Hunt|The First Hunt]]
Each spring, communities observe the festival of [[./The First Hunt|the First Hunt]], the [[./Protokynion|Protokynion]]. In ancient times, the festival involved hunting, but in the modern form of observance, it is a day of picnics, outdoor games, and frolicking that has little to do with Nylea except that it celebrates the full flowering of spring. Tales tell of Nylea being passingly bitter about the celebration and, annually, visiting a First Hunt celebration in disguise. If she finds herself duly honored during the revelry, she blesses the event and might personally participate. If she finds no mention of her works, she curses those in attendance, sometimes sending rampaging beasts to disrupt the event or turning participants into game animals for true hunters to stalk.
#### [[./Origin of the Catoblepas|Origin of the Catoblepas]], Another Perspective
When a herder boasted that his cattle were Mythscara’s finest because [[./Heliod|Heliod]] and Nylea had created them, [[./Heliod|Heliod]] persuaded [[./Mogis|Mogis]] to curse the cattle, transforming them into the first [[./Catoblepases|Catoblepases]] [[./Heliod|Heliod]] had hoped to win Nylea’s favor by defending her honor in this way, but she was outraged to be associated with the creation of these abominations. To this day, Nylea offers a boon to anyone who hunts down a catoblepas and brings its head to her sacred grove.

#### [[./The Three Hunters|The Three Hunters]]
Three young children from wealthy families were hunting for sport in the [[./Nessian Wood|Nessian Wood]]. Nylea accosted them before they had taken any prey and gave each a chance to bring her a gift that would atone for their intentions. The first man killed a stag and made an offering of it in her name, so she turned him into a stag to compensate for the one he had killed. The second offered [[./Wealth|wealth]] from his family coffers, so she turned him into a tree clinging to a cliff face by one root. The third, remorseful, threw herself on a bed of moss, and a cerulean butterfly came to rest on her hand. Carefully, she carried the butterfly back to Nylea. She not only spared her, but blessed her house and all her descendants.

#### [[./The Tragedy of Arasta|The Tragedy of Arasta]]
In ages long past, Nylea loved her dryad companion, [[./Arasta|Arasta]], as a sister and the two spread wonders across Mythscara. One day, [[./Phenax|Phenax]], envious of the pair and stung by some forgotten slight, transformed [[./Arasta|Arasta]] into a terrible monster to prove that the goddess’s love was based on beauty, not true kinship. Seeing the unfamiliar creature, Nylea was horrified and drove her away. Shattered, [[./Arasta|Arasta]] retreated and has terrorized the gods’ servants ever since. To this day, Nylea remains deeply pained by [[./Arasta|Arasta]]’s loss. Knowing that only [[./Phenax|Phenax]] can undo the curse he laid upon the dryad, Nylea often sends her champions to learn the secret of what might restore her friend.

## Nylea's Champions
**Alignment:** Usually neutral, often good

**Suggested [[./Classes|Classes]]:** Barbarian, cleric, druid, ranger

**Suggested Cleric Domains:** [[./Nature|Nature]]

**Suggested Backgrounds:** Folk hero, hermit, outlander

Most champions of Nylea understand the cycles of [[./Nature|nature]]—embracing life, death, and rebirth. They might commit violence when necessary but never revel in it, advocating for the proper treatment of animals, plants, and the natural world. Her current champion, [[./Haldir|Haldir]] Holagwyn, traverses the [[./Ozmium Coastlands|Ozmium Coastlands]] and acts as a bridge between [[./Nature|nature]] and civilization. After the fall of [[./Ruination|Ruination]], no temples have been erected in Nylea's honor, so most who follow her path do so after a striking event.

#### Nylea's Favor
Nylea chooses champions who will tirelessly defend the natural world, regardless of their mortal ties and associations. She cares more for consistency of actions than for vows of loyalty and expressions of devotion. Whether you are silently devoted to her or vociferous in your praise, it is your actions in her name that will prompt her to continue her support—or withdraw it.

Because her interests are often tied to natural forces, Nylea’s attentions can be unpredictable. What made the god turn her attention to you? What act of charity or feat of skill made her think you would be a good champion?

#### Earning and Losing Piety
You increase your piety score to Nylea when you expand the god’s influence in the world in a concrete way through acts such as these:

- Healing a sick or injured wild animal
- Stopping those who hunt for sport or profit
- Proving your worth in a contest of archery
- Slaying an aberration, a fiend, or an undead

Your piety score to Nylea decreases if you diminish Nylea’s influence in the world, fail to defend [[./Nature|nature]], or offend her sensibilities through acts such as these:

- Killing an animal for any reason other than necessity
- Dedicating a building or making a sacrifice to any god, including Nylea
- Protecting a city or farm from natural dangers
