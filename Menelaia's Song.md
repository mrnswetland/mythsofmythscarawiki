Long ago, a master lyrist named [[./Menelaia|Menelaia]] mourned her lover, [[./Pero|Pero]]. She entered the [[./Winter Nexus|Winter Nexus]], a cave on the edge of [[./Vinerus|Vinerus]] that leads to the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], and played a love song to lure [[./Pero|Pero]]’s soul back to the mortal world. When [[./Erebos|Erebos]] saw this, he became furious, and he extended his whip to draw both of the lovers back. But [[./Menelaia|Menelaia]] was beloved of [[./Nylea|Nylea]], and that god blocked [[./Erebos|Erebos]]’s whip with vines. The two lovers lived long lives together. [[./Erebos|Erebos]] had the last word, however, tormenting both of the lovers in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]]. To this day, this turn of events plagues [[./Nylea|Nylea]], who seeks a way to bring the lovers peace.
