## Sorcerous Origins

Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic. Choose the draconic bloodline below or one from another source.

## Aberrant Mind Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?

As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a possible origin of your power.

##### Aberrant Origins

|d6|Origin|
|---|---|
|1|You were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. You are convinced that a tentacle is now growing on you, but no one else can see it.|
|2|A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.|
|3|You once suffered the dominating powers of an aboleth, leaving a psychic splinter in your mind.|
|4|You were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but the ceremorphosis never completed. And now its psionic power is yours. When you use it, your flesh shines with a strange mucus.|
|5|As a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked like a flumph or a strange platypus-like creature. One day, it gifted you with psionic powers, which have ended up being not so imaginary.|
|6|Your nightmares whisper the truth to you: your psionic powers are not your own. You draw them from your parasitic twin!|

#### Psionic Spells

_1st-level Aberrant Mind feature_

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

##### Psionic Spells

|Sorcerer Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[arms of Hadar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2311-arms-of-hadar), [dissonant whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2314-dissonant-whispers), [mind sliver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/718568-mind-sliver)|
|3rd|[calm emotions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2023-calm-emotions), [detect thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2067-detect-thoughts)|
|5th|[hunger of Hadar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2339-hunger-of-hadar), [sending](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2243-sending)|
|7th|[Evard’s black tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2344-evards-black-tentacles), [summon aberration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/718613-summon-aberration) (a spell in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/magical-miscellany#SummonAberration "chapter 3"))|
|9th|[Rary’s telepathic bond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2356-rarys-telepathic-bond), [telekinesis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2273-telekinesis)|

#### Telepathic Speech

_1st-level Aberrant Mind feature_

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) or die or if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

#### Psionic Sorcery

_6th-level Aberrant Mind feature_

When you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no material components, unless they are consumed by the spell.

#### Psychic Defenses

_6th-level Aberrant Mind feature_

You gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

#### Revelation in Flesh

_14th-level Aberrant Mind feature_

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:

- You can see any [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn’t behind total cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or shines with an otherworldly light.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow writhing cilia that extend through your clothing.
- Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition).

#### Warping Implosion

_18th-level Aberrant Mind feature_

You can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

## Clockwork Soul Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lineage, might have become entangled in the machinations of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.

#### Clockwork Magic

_1st-level Clockwork Soul feature_

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

##### Clockwork Spells

|Sorcerer Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[alarm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1991-alarm), [protection from evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good)|
|3rd|[aid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1990-aid), [lesser restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2164-lesser-restoration)|
|5th|[dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic), [protection from energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2220-protection-from-energy)|
|7th|[freedom of movement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2116-freedom-of-movement), [summon construct](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/721195-summon-construct) (a spell in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/magical-miscellany#SummonConstruct "chapter 3"))|
|9th|[greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2129-greater-restoration), [wall of force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2292-wall-of-force)|

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your sorcerer spells.

##### Manifestations of Order

|d6|Manifestation|
|---|---|
|1|Spectral cogwheels hover behind you.|
|2|The hands of a clock spin in your eyes.|
|3|Your skin glows with a brassy sheen.|
|4|Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body.|
|5|Your spellcasting focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism.|
|6|The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic.|

#### Restore Balance

_1st-level Clockwork Soul feature_

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Bastion of Law

_6th-level Clockwork Soul feature_

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you.

The ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

#### Trance of Order

_14th-level Clockwork Soul feature_

You gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can’t benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

#### Clockwork Cavalcade

_18th-level Clockwork Soul feature_

You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing:

- The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.
- Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.
- Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.

Once you use this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.

## Divine Soul

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

#### Divine Soul Features

|Sorcerer Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|1st|Divine Magic, Favored by the Gods|
|6th|Empowered Healing|
|14th|Otherworldly Wings|
|18th|Unearthly Recovery|

#### Divine Magic

Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

|Affinity|Spell|
|---|---|
|Good|[cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-cure-wounds)|
|Evil|[inflict wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2156-inflict-wounds)|
|Law|[bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless)|
|Chaos|[bane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2009-bane)|
|Neutrality|[protection from evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good)|

#### Favored by the Gods

Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Empowered Healing

Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). You can use this feature only once per turn.

#### Otherworldly Wings

Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

#### Unearthly Recovery

At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Bloodline Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

##### Draconic Ancestry

|Dragon|Damage Type|
|---|---|
|Black|Acid|
|Blue|Lightning|
|Brass|Fire|
|Bronze|Lightning|
|Copper|Acid|
|Gold|Fire|
|Green|Poison|
|Red|Fire|
|Silver|Cold|
|White|Cold|

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

#### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

#### Dragon Wings

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

#### Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) (if you chose awe) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

## Lunar Sorcery

On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world’s three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world’s twelve moons.

You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells—perhaps making your pupils glow with the color of a moon from your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other effect.

#### Lunar Embodiment

_1st-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lunar Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

##### Lunar Spells
|Sorcerer Level|Full Moon Spell|New Moon Spell|Crescent Moon Spell|
|---|---|---|---|
|1st|[shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2247-shield)|[ray of sickness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2318-ray-of-sickness)|[color spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2031-color-spray)|
|3rd|[lesser restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2164-lesser-restoration)|[blindness/deafness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2018-blindness-deafness)|[alter self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1992-alter-self)|
|5th|[dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic)|[vampiric touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2289-vampiric-touch)|[phantom steed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2203-phantom-steed)|
|7th|[death ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2061-death-ward)|[confusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2038-confusion)|[hallucinatory terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2136-hallucinatory-terrain)|
|9th|[Rary’s telepathic bond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2356-rarys-telepathic-bond)|[hold monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2146-hold-monster)|[mislead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2194-mislead)|

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose what lunar phase manifests its power through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon. While in the chosen phase, you can cast one 1st-level spell of the associated phase in the Lunar Spells table once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Moon Fire

_1st-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

You can call down the radiant light of the moon on command. You learn the [sacred flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2236-sacred-flame) spell, which doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer cantrips you know. When you cast the spell, you can target one creature as normal or target two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other.

#### Lunar Boons

_6th-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

The current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:

**Full Moon.** Abjuration and divination spells

**New Moon.** Enchantment and necromancy spells

**Crescent Moon.** Illusion and transmutation spells

Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Waxing and Waning

_6th-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

You gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change your current Lunar Embodiment phase to a different one.

You can now cast one 1st-level spell from each lunar phase of the Lunar Spells table once without expending a spell slot, provided your current phase is the same as the lunar phase spell. Once you cast a lunar phase spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Lunar Empowerment

_14th-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

The power of a lunar phase saturates your being. While you are in a Lunar Embodiment phase, you also gain the following benefit associated with that phase:

**Full Moon.** You can use a bonus action to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet or to douse the light. In addition, you and creatures of your choice have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) and Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks while within the bright light you shed.

**New Moon.** You have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. In addition, while you are entirely in darkness, attack rolls have disadvantage against you.

**Crescent Moon.** You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

#### Lunar Phenomenon

_18th-Level Lunar Sorcery Feature_

As a bonus action, you can tap into a special power of your current Lunar Embodiment phase. Alternatively, as part of the bonus action you take to change your lunar phase using the Waxing and Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar phase you are entering:

**Full Moon.** You radiate moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) until the end of its next turn. In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.

**New Moon.** You momentarily emanate gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) until the end of your next turn, or until immediately after you make an attack roll or cast a spell.

**Crescent Moon.** You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that creature gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

Once you use one of these bonus action benefits, you can’t use that benefit again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

## Shadow Magic

You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it.

The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

##### Shadow Sorcerer Quirks

|d6|Quirk|
|---|---|
|1|You are always icy cold to the touch.|
|2|When you are asleep, you don’t appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).|
|3|You barely bleed, even when badly injured.|
|4|Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you.|
|5|You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently.|
|6|You blinked. Once. Last week.|

#### Shadow Magic Features

|Sorcerer Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|1st|Eyes of the Dark, Strength of the Grave|
|3rd|Eyes of the Dark ([darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2058-darkness))|
|6th|Hound of Ill Omen|
|14th|Shadow Walk|
|18th|Umbral Form|

#### Eyes of the Dark

Starting at 1st level, you have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the [darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2058-darkness) spell, which doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.

#### Strength of the Grave

Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.

After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

#### Hound of Ill Omen

At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the [dire wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16841-dire-wolf) statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C in the Player’s Handbook), with the following changes:

- The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.

#### Shadow Walk

At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.

#### Umbral Form

Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

## Storm Sorcery

Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.

Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship’s crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.

#### Storm Sorcery Features

|Sorcerer Level|Feature|
|---|---|
|1st|Wind Speaker, Tempestuous Magic|
|6th|Heart of the Storm, Storm Guide|
|14th|Storm’s Fury|
|18th|Wind Soul|

#### Wind Speaker

The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.

#### Tempestuous Magic

Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Heart of the Storm

At 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your sorcerer level.

#### Storm Guide

At 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.

If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.

If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn’t alter the speed of the wind.

#### Storm’s Fury

Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

#### Wind Soul

At 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.

You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Wild Magic Legacy[](https://www.dndbeyond.com/legacy)

Your innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause. However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

#### Wild Magic Surge

Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

#### Tides of Chaos

Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

#### Bend Luck

Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

#### Controlled Chaos

At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

#### Spell Bombardment

Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

## Light Weaver

Your powers are drawn from the spark of light kindled within you. In places of great darkness, there are always those born with the affinity for light, and every shadow must have a shining source. The magic within you represents cosmic balance, and like the light, your magic flickers from radiance to darkness moment to moment.

#### Trick of the Light

Starting at 1st level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.

#### Flickering Aura

Starting at 1st level, you can choose whether your magic is light-shifted or dark-shifted. You can change your choice at the end of a long rest.

While light-shifted you can use an action to emit an aura of bright light in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on yourself. While the aura persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright light by 5 feet, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet.

While dark-shifted you gain the same ability, but you project an aura of nonmagical darkness.

#### Refraction Shield

At 6th level, you can manipulate the light around you for protection. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically create a shield of light. While the shield is in place, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield flashes with searing energy, and the attacker takes 2d8 radiant damage if you are light-shifted or 2d8 necrotic damage if you are dark-shifted. The shield disappears if you fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) or after 10 minutes.

#### Aura Magnification

Starting at 14th level, your manipulation of the light around you becomes masterful. While light-shifted, your Flickering Aura produces sunlight. While dark-shifted, your aura produces magical darkness.

If any of this aura’s area overlaps with an area of light or darkness created by a spell equal to or lower than the level of your highest available spell slot, the spell that created the light or darkness is dispelled.

#### Spell Blind

Beginning at 18th level, your spell energy overwhelms your target’s perceptions. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to empower your Flickering Aura. For 1 minute or until you lose your [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) until the aura ends.

The mysterious weave and flow of magic is feared by many folk across Exandria. But while some spellcasters must study the essence and nature of magic in the hope of learning to harness it, sorcerers possess an innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that shape the world. For some sorcerers, the body becomes a conduit for this power, which is collected and stored in the form of natural runes—and which sees a sorcerer named as a Runechild.

The talents of a Runechild are rare, and sorcerers with this origin are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets of their runes can help understand the mysteries of magic. Others sometimes seek to enslave Runechild sorcerers, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for diabolic pursuits. Runechild sorcerers were subjugated throughout the Age of Arcanum, and many of their contemporaries now search for ways to hide their essence—a task that isn’t easy given the revealing nature of their gifts.

#### Essence Runes

At 1st level, your body begins to express your innate magic as runes traced out across your skin. You start with 1 essence rune, and gain an additional rune whenever you gain a level in this class. These runes can manifest anywhere on your body, though the first usually manifests on the forehead. Your essence runes remain invisible when inert.

At the end of a turn during which you spent one or more sorcery points, a number of your essence runes equal to the number of sorcery points you spent begin to glow with stored energy, becoming charged runes. You use these charged runes to power your Runechild subclass features. If you have 5 or more charged runes, you emit bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

As a bonus action, you may spend a sorcery point to convert two essence runes into two charged runes. If you have no sorcery points and no charged runes, you can convert a single essence rune into a charged rune as an action.

When you expend a charged rune to use one of your Runechild features, it returns to being an inert essence rune. Any charged runes also revert to inert essence runes after you finish a long rest.

#### Runic Magic

Beginning at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Runic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

##### Runic Spells
|Sorcerer Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|[longstrider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2171-longstrider), [protection from evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2221-protection-from-evil-and-good)|

|9th|[greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2129-greater-restoration), [telekinesis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2273-telekinesis)|

#### Glyph of Aegis

Starting at 1st level, you can release the stored arcane power within your runes to absorb or deflect threatening attacks. Whenever you take damage, you can expend any number of charged runes as a reaction. Roll a number of d6s equal to the number of runes you expended, and reduce the damage by the total.

When you reach 6th level, you can touch a creature as an action and expend up to 3 charged runes to transfer your protective power to it for up to 1 hour. The next time that creature takes damage within the next hour, it rolls 1d6 per charged rune spent and reduces the damage by the total. You can’t transfer this power to a creature already under the effect of Glyph of Aegis.

Your Glyph of Aegis die becomes a d8 at 14th level.

#### Sigilic Augmentation

At 6th level, you can channel your runes to temporarily bolster your physical capabilities. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check, you can expend a charged rune as a reaction to gain advantage on the roll.

In addition, when you are forced to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a charged rune to gain advantage on the saving throw. Once you use this feature in this way, you can’t use it in this way again until you complete a long rest.

#### Manifest Inscriptions

Also at 6th level, you can reveal hidden glyphs and enchantments that surround you. As an action, you expend one charged rune to reveal hidden or invisible arcane traps, marks, runes, wards, sensors, or glyphs within 60 feet of you. They glow with dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute.

You have advantage on Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks to discern the nature of any magic revealed in this way for the duration. If the glyphs you reveal mean something in a language you can’t read, you can understand them while they are glowing as if you knew that language.

#### Runic Torrent

Upon reaching 14th level, you can channel runic energy to overpower even the staunchest defenses. When you cast a spell, you can expend 2 charged runes to cause the spell to deal force damage instead of its usual damage types. Additionally, all creatures targeted by the spell or within the spell’s area must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) or pushed up to 15 feet away from the spell’s point of origin (your choice).

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

#### Arcane Exemplar

Starting at 18th level, you can use a bonus action and expend a charged rune to become a being of pure magical energy. While in your exemplar form, you gain the following benefits:

- You have a flying speed of 60 feet.
- Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your sorcerer spells.
- You have resistance to damage dealt by spells.
- Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to the spell’s level.

Your exemplar form lasts until the end of your turn. However, you can expend a charged rune at the end of your turn (no action required) to extend the duration until the end of your next turn. When your exemplar form ends, you are [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.
