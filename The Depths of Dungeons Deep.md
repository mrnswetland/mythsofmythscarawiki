> _A prophecy given by the former oracle of [[./Klothys|Klothys]]_ 
> 
> In the whispering pines, where shadows creep low, 
> A dungeon of dread, secrets it will bestow. 
> Seven shall venture, hearts stout and bold, 
> To challenge the darkness, a tale yet untold. 
> 
> First, the Ranger, cloaked in furs of foes, 
> Must navigate pathways, where none have been close. 
> Next, the Barbarian, with rage as his guide, 
> Must shatter the gate, where evil does hide. 
> The Rogue, with shadows both friend and guide, 
> Must open new paths, where secrets reside. 
> The Artificer, with arcane knowledge in hand, 
> Must decipher riddles, across the black sands. 
> The Cleric, with wings as a shield and a light, 
> Must capture foul spirits, that dance in the night. 
> The Sorcerer, with spells that aid or ignite, 
> Must waken the slumbering, with rituals of lost light.
> The Paladin, with unwavering convictions, 
> Must face the true evil, from their old missions. 
> 
> Six shall emerge, forever entwined, 
> Marked by the dungeon, their purpose redefined. 
> One hero shall fall, a sacrifice made, 
> For the world's salvation, a terrible price paid. 
> 
> Beware, adventurers, for glory may fade,
> In the face of the darkness, a terrible shade. 
> But with courage united, and hearts set ablaze, 
> They may conquer the dungeon, and usher in new days.
