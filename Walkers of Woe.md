The nightmarish creatures known as woe striders are said to be products of [[./Klothys|Klothys]]â€™s punishment. These beings descend from an age when some mortals learned to unshackle themselves from the strands of destiny. To what end is a question lost to time, but [[./Klothys|Klothys]] put a quick end to these blasphemers and eradicated nearly all knowledge of their methods. Ever since, the shades of these accursed mortals have walked the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] as woe striders, monstrosities endlessly seeking strands of destiny that they might use to replace their own discarded lots.
