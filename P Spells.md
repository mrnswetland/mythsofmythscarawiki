### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PasswithoutTrace)[Pass without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2201-pass-without-trace)

_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#Passwall)[Passwall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2200-passwall)

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)

**Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PhantasmalForce)[Phantasmal Force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2332-phantasmal-force)

_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

_4th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PhantomSteed)[Phantom Steed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2203-phantom-steed)

_3rd-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PlanarAlly)[Planar Ally](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2204-planar-ally)

_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM’s choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PlanarBinding)[Planar Binding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2205-planar-binding)

_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 24 hours

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted [magic circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2174-magic-circle) in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PlaneShift)[Plane Shift](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2206-plane-shift)

_7th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PlantGrowth)[Plant Growth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2207-plant-growth)

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PoisonSpray)[Poison Spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2208-poison-spray)

_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#Polymorph)[Polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2209-polymorph)

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition).

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PowerWordHeal)[Power Word Heal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2366-power-word-heal)

_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PowerWordKill)[Power Word Kill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2210-power-word-kill)

_9th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PowerWordStun)[Power Word Stun](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2211-power-word-stun)

_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition). Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PrayerofHealing)[Prayer of Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2212-prayer-of-healing)

_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#Prestidigitation)[Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2213-prestidigitation)

_Transmutation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PrismaticSpray)[Prismatic Spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2214-prismatic-spray)

_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

1. _**Red.**_ The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
2. _**Orange.**_ The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
3. _**Yellow.**_ The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
4. _**Green.**_ The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
5. _**Blue.**_ The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
6. _**Indigo.**_ On a failed save, the target is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the [petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
    
7. _**Violet.**_ On a failed save, the target is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM’s choosing and is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
    
8. _**Special.**_ The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#PrismaticWall)[Prismatic Wall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2215-prismatic-wall)

_9th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. [Antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1999-antimagic-field) has no effect on the wall, and [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic) can affect only the violet layer.

1. _**Red.**_ The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
    
2. _**Orange.**_ The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
    
3. _**Yellow.**_ The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
    
4. _**Green.**_ The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A [passwall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2200-passwall) spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.
    
5. _**Blue.**_ The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
    
6. _**Indigo.**_ On a failed save, the creature is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the [petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.
    

While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a [daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2060-daylight) spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.

8. _**Violet.**_ On a failed save, the creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM’s choosing and is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic) spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/spell-descriptions-pr#ProgrammedIllusion)[Programmed Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2218-programmed-illusion)

_6th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 500 miles

**Components:** V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) and [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) in regard to your own surroundings.

_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
