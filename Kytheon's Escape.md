Many know the story of [[./Kytheon Iora|Kytheon Iora]], an orphan from [[./Borda|Borda]] who took up [[./Heliod|Heliod]]’s spear and attempted to kill [[./Erebos|Erebos]] himself.

Only the high priests of [[./Erebos|Erebos]], however, know that Kytheon’s soul isn’t in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], having somehow escaped right before [[./Erebos|Erebos]]’s eyes.
