What does it mean to live in harmony with the land? A Druid might tell you that it means leaving not a trace you were there - live by what the land provides, forge not anything that nature did not forge herself. An [[./Elf|elf]] would undoubtedly have their thoughts as well. The Groakii would respectfully disagree. For these frog-like people, building, engineering, technology need not conflict with the ecologies they call home but instead work in tandem with it. Whether from the high treetops, or the sprawling wetlands, the Groakii have become masters of their environments, harnessing the powers of wind and water to drive their metropolises and push on towards ever greater understandings of the natural sciences.
