Three young children from wealthy families were hunting for sport in the [[./Nessian Wood|Nessian Wood]]. [[./Nylea|Nylea]] accosted them before they had taken any prey and gave each a chance to bring her a gift that would atone for their intentions. The first man killed a stag and made an offering of it in her name, so she turned him into a stag to compensate for the one he had killed. The second offered [[./Wealth|wealth]] from his family coffers, so she turned him into a tree clinging to a cliff face by one root. The third, remorseful, threw herself on a bed of moss, and a cerulean butterfly came to rest on her hand. Carefully, she carried the butterfly back to [[./Nylea|Nylea]]. She not only spared her, but blessed her house and all her descendants.
