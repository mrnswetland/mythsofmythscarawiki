As an action, this creature may initiate a Duel with a willing target creature within 5 ft. of them.
	• The dueling creatures go in their initiative order. They can only take an Action or Bonus Action, and may move up to half their Movement Speed. 
	• Duelists can only make one Attack Roll per round, or use Actions that cause the target to make only one Saving Throw per round. 
	• Any damage or condition inflicted carries over after the Duel, with no rounds elapsed for the effect’s duration. 
	• When a duelist successfully damages the other duelist with an Attack Roll or a failed Saving Throw, they earn 1 point. 
	• The Duel goes for a number of rounds determined by the feature in parentheses. 
	• At the end of the Duel, whoever has the highest points is considered the victor, with the result determined by the feature. If there is a tie, nothing happens.

These are typical results you can inflict on the one who failed the duel, but you are free to create your own.
	• Target suffers the [[./Vulnerable Condition|Vulnerable Condition]]. 
	• Target suffers the [[./Lethargic Condition|Lethargic Condition]]. 
	• The victor uses a powerful attack against the target. This can be any combination of effects, such as the attack being made at Advantage, or the attack always inflicting a Critical on hit.
