Years ago, [[./Keranos|Keranos]] received an exquisitely cut sapphire set in a delicate silver diadem as an offering. Deeply appreciative of the skill and craftsmanship required to create it, [[./Keranos|Keranos]] imbued the gem with a spark of divine genius. Inventors and philosophers coveted the diadem, for it conferred a fraction of [[./Keranos|Keranos]]’s inspiration to the wearer—granting incredible insights or fracturing the wearer’s sanity. Its last owner, the tormented genius [[./Zexso the Unblinking|Zexso the Unblinking]], is said to have created a massive contraption to assure that the lightning diadem wouldn’t shatter the mind of any other mortal. The inventor’s machine launched the diadem into the heavens, where it’s said to have landed upon a griffin-inhabited island floating in the clouds.
