#### Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

##### Agonizing Blast

_Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip_

When you cast [eldritch blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2082-eldritch-blast), add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

##### Aspect of the Moon

_Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature_

You no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading your Book of Shadows and keeping watch.

##### Beast Speech

You can cast [speak with animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals) at will, without expending a spell slot.

##### Beguiling Influence

##### Bewitching Whispers

_Prerequisite: 7th level_

You can cast [compulsion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2036-compulsion) once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

##### Bond of the Talisman

_Prerequisite: 12th-level warlock, Pact of the Talisman feature_

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you. The teleportation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

##### Book of Ancient Secrets

_Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature_

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

##### Chains of Carceri

_Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature_

You can cast [hold monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2146-hold-monster) at will — targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental — without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

##### Cloak of Flies

_Prerequisite: 5th level_

As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).

_Prerequisite: 5th-level warlock, Pact of the Tome feature_

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

You can cast the [sending](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2243-sending) spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.

##### Fiendish Vigor

You can cast [false life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2093-false-life) on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) and [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) to your own surroundings.

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) if you don’t already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Investment of the Chain Master
