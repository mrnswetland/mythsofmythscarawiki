In ages past, a warrior of tremendous strength stalked the battlefield. As a lone combatant, he was unbeatable, but he suffered when groups rose to oppose him. After one such defeat, the warrior was so filled with wrath that he murdered his entire village in [[./Mogis|Mogis]]’s name. The god, delighted by this display, gifted the warrior with his own ferocity, remaking him as a reflection of [[./Mogis|Mogis]]’s wrath and an engine of destruction in combat. This warrior became the first minotaur, and many minotaurs still worship [[./Mogis|Mogis]], as he is their creator and they were made in his image.
