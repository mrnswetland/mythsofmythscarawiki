Some claim that [[./Athreos|Athreos]] doesn’t collect coins out of greed but because he’s looking for five specific treasures. Apocryphal writings in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] library of [[Oneirrakthys|Oneirrakthys]] say that [[./Athreos|Athreos]] was the first mortal to die. When he came to face the gods, he brought a single treasure as an offering to each of Mythscara’s five mightiest deities, hoping to receive a peaceful place among them in return.
