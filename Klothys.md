## God of Destiny
Believed to have sprung into existence during [[Mythscara|Mythscara]]’s earliest days, Klothys is the god of destiny and, along with [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]], one of the plane’s original deities. She oversees the order of the cosmos, ensuring that all things remain in their proper place, knowing how easily the cosmic balance could be undone if she were not vigilant. On the heels of a near-catastrophic upset of the cosmic order—the rise to godhood and subsequent defeat of the satyr [[./Jakel|Jakel]]—Klothys has emerged from the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] for the first time in mortal memory to untangle the strands of destiny and set the world right.

Klothys typically appears as a woman with six curling horns and an impossibly long mane of pale hair that cascades around her horns, drapes over her eyes, and spools into her spear-like weapon and the various other spindles she carries.

Beneath her outward calm, Klothys seethes at the way mortals and gods alike have pulled apart and rearranged the threads of destiny to feed their petty ambitions. Her peaceful mien falls away in the presence of such villains. In her rage, her red-glowing eyes come into view through the veil of her hair, and she wields burning strands of hair as a devastating weapon.

## Klothys's Influence
Klothys is the embodiment and enforcer of destiny. Largely forgotten after ages spent in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], Klothys has only recently emerged, brimming with silent frustration at the state of Mythscara.

Each strand of Klothys’s hair is part of the fabric of destiny, the natural order that underpins all existence. Her followers claim to see these strands woven into all things, granting them understanding of cosmic truths and insights into how the future should unfold.

Klothys withdrew to the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] ages ago to keep watch over the imprisoned titans and ensure they couldn’t escape and destroy the order she had established. Due to this undertaking, she is also the god of secrets best kept quiet and powers best untouched.

#### Klothys's Goals
Once content to oversee and preserve destiny from the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], Klothys now endeavors to undo the cosmic damage caused by [[./Heliod|Heliod]], [[./Jakel|Jakel]], and ambitious mortals in recent years. The ways in which they ravaged reality to realize their selfish dreams has threatened Mythscara, and only by untangling the strands of destiny can Klothys set things right. The status quo she seeks to restore, however, comes with a cost in mortal casualties and societal upheaval that would accompany this process. She intends to humble the same institutions that condoned or committed these crimes against Mythscara. When her efforts have laid low the proud, the defiant, and the exploitative, then Klothys will have restored the natural order and ensured the world’s [[./Survival|survival]].

#### Divine Relationships
Klothys views many of the gods with disdain, considering them to be complicit in [[./Jakel|Jakel]]’s theogenesis, [[./Heliod|Heliod]]’s acts of arrogance, or both. She reserves special contempt for [[./Heliod|Heliod]] and his champions, relishing every opportunity to teach them humility.

Klothys also clashes with other gods associated with order and progress, seeing their defiance of the natural order as a dangerous affront. [[./Ephara|Ephara]]’s ravenous colonization, [[./Iroas|Iroas]]’s passion for overcoming insurmountable odds, and [[./Karametra|Karametra]]’s taming of [[./Nature|nature]] all run the risk of inspiring ambitious mortals who lust for ever more power and strain to break away from their proper place in the cosmos.

Klothys respects the other gods whose interests balance creation and destruction, such as [[./Thassa|Thassa]], [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]], and [[./Nylea|Nylea]], considering them better attuned to Mythscara’s needs and destiny’s myriad outcomes. [[./Nylea|Nylea]] shares Klothys’s delight in the world’s natural cycles. [[./Purphoros|Purphoros]]’s willingness to build and demolish appeases Klothys—as well as the fact that he despises [[./Heliod|Heliod]] as much as she does.

Klothys’s relationships with [[./Erebos|Erebos]] and [[./Athreos|Athreos]] are complicated. Ages spent in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] with [[./Erebos|Erebos]] have driven home for her how arrogant and tyrannical he is, as ready to commit the same sins as [[./Heliod|Heliod]] if given the opportunity. Even so, [[./Erebos|Erebos]] and Klothys maintain a level of mutual respect. Until recently, Klothys and [[./Athreos|Athreos]] were unflappable allies. But now her emergence from the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] has blurred the borders between the realms, as she draws horrors into the mortal realm with her and thereby raises [[./Athreos|Athreos]]’s ire.

Of course, Klothys trusts no other god as much as she does [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]], who also recalls Mythscara’s earliest hours. The two have a deep respect for one another.

## Worshipping Klothys
Klothys doesn’t trace her origins to mortal devotion, and she has languished in obscurity for almost the whole of [[./Human|human]] [[./History|history]]. Unlike the other gods (except [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]]), she doesn’t need worship to sustain or empower her, and she doesn’t seek out reverence or demand it. By and large, mortals are irrelevant to her, except insofar as they have played a role in tangling the strands of destiny by defying [[./Nature|nature]]’s order.

## Myths of Klothys
Klothys is barely remembered in the mortal world, having sequestered herself in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] while [[./Human|human]] civilization was in its infancy. Some surviving myths speak of a personified “destiny” in a way that vaguely suggests the possibility of an actual god’s involvement.

#### [[./Rage of Titans|Rage of Titans]]
The greatest threat to the young world of Theros was the godlike race of titans, born from the same swirling chaos as the world itself. Before any order could be imposed on the world, the titans had to be contained. [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] and Klothys worked together to imprison the titans in the deepest pits of the [[./Underworld|Underworld]]. Klothys voluntarily bound herself in the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] to keep the titans imprisoned, but that is, after all, the [[./Nature|nature]] of destiny: once the natural order of the world had been put in place and preserved, no further action should have been required on her part to maintain it.
#### [[./The Smoking Strand|The Smoking Strand]]
Hidden far from civilized coasts lies a strand of Klothys’s hair that she purposefully plucked. Knotted in on itself, the strand appears as a seething ball of dense smoke. Any who touch the strand risk having it invade them, infecting them with a pernicious destiny that Klothys herself tore from the natural order. None can say what terrible destiny [[./The Smoking Strand|the Smoking Strand]] drives its possessor toward, but the ruins within which it lies might give some hint—caverns burrowed deep into a mountain of petrified bodies, the twisted obsidian corpses of humanoids and animals alike.
#### [[./Twins at War|Twins at War]]
The newly formed gods [[./Kruphix|Kruphix]] and Klothys emerged from opposite sides of the roiling tangle of possibilities that eventually gave birth to Mythscara. At first the two battled for supremacy, but they soon realized their conflict left their young world vulnerable to dangers from both inside and out. Putting their rivalry aside, the pair agreed it was better to share and have something than let their struggles destroy all creation.
#### [[./Walkers of Woe|Walkers of Woe]]
The nightmarish creatures known as woe striders are said to be products of Klothys’s punishment. These beings descend from an age when some mortals learned to unshackle themselves from the strands of destiny. To what end is a question lost to time, but Klothys put a quick end to these blasphemers and eradicated nearly all knowledge of their methods. Ever since, the shades of these accursed mortals have walked the [[./Underworld|Underworld]] as woe striders, monstrosities endlessly seeking strands of destiny that they might use to replace their own discarded lots.

## Klothys's Champions
**Alignment:** Usually neutral

**Suggested [[./Classes|Classes]]:** Barbarian, cleric, ranger, warlock

**Suggested Cleric Domains:** Knowledge, War

**Suggested Backgrounds:** Folk hero, hermit, outlander, sage

Most champions of Klothys believe it is their destiny to fulfill a particular role or seek answers to omens they struggle to understand. They are passionate about punishing those who violate the cosmological order.

#### Klothys's Favor
Klothys hasn’t had a mortal champion before. Upon emerging from the [[./Underworld|Underworld]], she created a host of [[./Nyxborn|Nyxborn]] agents to help her restore Mythscara to its proper path. You might be one of these so-called Agents of Destiny, single-minded in the purpose for which you were made. Or you might be among the first of a new cadre of followers of Klothys. 

#### Earning and Losing Piety
You increase your piety score to Klothys when you expand the god’s influence in the world in a concrete way through acts such as these:

- Defeating a creature that has stepped out of its place
- Repairing a significant wound dealt to destiny by the gods’ ambitions
- Teaching people about Klothys, her [[./Nature|nature]], and her return

Your piety score to Klothys decreases if you diminish her influence in the world, contradict her ideals, or threaten the integrity of destiny through acts such as these:

- Undoing a deserved punishment or curse suffered by another creature
- Willfully destroying a natural wonder
- Assisting a creature in undermining the natural order or exploiting destiny
