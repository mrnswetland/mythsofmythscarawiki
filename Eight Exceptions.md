Eight times in the course of history, [[./Athreos|Athreos]] has purposely allowed a mortal to delay their death or temporarily return from the [[./Underworld|Underworld]]. These individuals were restored as living beings (not as [[./Returned|Returned]]) to complete particular tasks. As a record of these exceptions, [[./Athreos|Athreos]] bears a [[./Returned|Returned]]-like mask of each individual. Despite centuries between bargains, though, no one who [[./Athreos|Athreos]] has made an exception for has ever [[./Returned|returned]]. As a result, the River Guide refuses to make another exception. He might be convinced to do otherwise were someone to bring one of the eight lost souls—such as [[./Biaas the Poison Drinker|Biaas the Poison Drinker]], [[./Dianyan Half-Heart|Dianyan Half-Heart]], or [[./Hundred-Damned Thasmudyan|Hundred-Damned Thasmudyan]]—before him for punishment.
